Henze, performed by Rundfunk Sinfonieorchester Berlin, conducted by Marek Janowski</title><content type="html">This set pairs two of Henze's later symphonies, from a time which he had embarked on a more conservative path. Though the performances are excellent (as far as I know), I find these symphonies to be less interesting than his earlier work.&lt;br /&gt;Henze's first symphony in twenty years, the seventh, is a markedly more traditional piece (and admittedly so, apparently, as Henze claimed he was trying to write in the tradition of Beethoven). The work is is very pleasing and, as these things go, is something I enjoy listening to, but I cannot shake the conservativeness of it. Certainly it is more daring than most Neo-Classical/Neo-Romantic works, and it breaks more traditions, but it is, at bottom, a far more conservative piece than what he used to write. And so I struggle with it. But, I cannot deny how compelling it is.&lt;br /&gt;The eighth symphony is, if anything, even more traditional than the seventh. It's programmatic, inspired by &lt;i&gt;A Midsummmer Night's Dream&lt;/i&gt;, and I guess a greater familiarity with that play (which I have read, but not for years) might help me here. Though there are touches of the old Henze, for the most part I find myself yearning for his younger radicalism, even though this is certainly fine work, as Neo-Romanticism goes. &lt;br /&gt;It's a fine collection if Neo-Romanticism is your thing, but it's not really my thing. Still better than a lot of the other revivalist stuff, though.&lt;br /&gt;7/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/2697250974796451886/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=2697250974796451886&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/2697250974796451886" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/2697250974796451886" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/symphonies-nos-7-8-2009-by-hw-henze.html" rel="alternate" title="Symphonies Nos. 7-8 (2009) by H.W.

Henze, performed by Rundfunk-Sinfoniorchester Berlin, conducted by Marek Janowski</title><content type="html">This is an excellent set of three of Henze's symphonies, showing him at perhaps his most radical stage. This is the kind of modernist "classical" that I just love; bonkers writing and bonkers arrangements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henze's third symphony starts off on a decidedly pastoral note, before sounding an ominous foreboding about 15 seconds in. Though the first notes might have convinced us this is something light and fluffy, we're utterly relieved of that so quickly, it's almost impossible to believed. In fact, the first movement ends up sounding more like a horror movie soundtrack than traditional classical music. I suspect that a number of major film composers leaned on Henze for their work. Henze employs all sorts of modernist techniques to both the writing and the arrangement.&lt;br /&gt;The second movement continues the downright ominous tone of the work, though, as fitting traditional symphonic construction, the pace is much slower. Again, the sound of that is some kind of demented horror movie. It says a lot to me that the main way I can describe this is with reference to a movie genre that barely existed at the time. I like how, about 7 minutes in, the movement appears to come to its conclusion, but no, it's just a diversion.&lt;br /&gt;The third movement continues the bonkers modernism with nods to the second movement at the very least (I guess I haven't listened to the whole thing enough to hear echoes of the first). &lt;br /&gt;All in all, this has to be one of my favourite symphonies of the era. A true classic from an incredibly underrated composer.&lt;br /&gt;Henze's fourth symphony is a little more restrained than the third. It's still the kind of stuff I love, but after hearing the third, it's just not as impressive. It sounds pretty similar, albeit less daring. It's still great stuff, just not as out there. I hear a definite attempt to reconcile serialist/modernist ideas with tradition.&lt;br /&gt;I had read that Henze calmed down once he moved to Italy in 1953, but it's hard to hear that in the 5th symphony, which is as cacophonous as the third, at least in its initial movement. There's a boldness here that I thought was lacking in the fourth symphony.&lt;br /&gt;The second movement is the most sedate thing of Henze's I have heard to date, which is a drastic contrast from the spastic first. It is, I suppose, a more traditional approach, but almost more effective.&lt;br /&gt;The third movement is probably the most "symphonic" of anything I've heard of Henze's so far, in that, at least in parts, it has most of the orchestra playing as one, which seems rare for Henze (at least at this stage of his career). That doesn't make it any less modern sounding. &lt;br /&gt;Another excellent work.&lt;br /&gt;9/10 </content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/1449646993216697733/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=1449646993216697733&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/1449646993216697733" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/1449646993216697733" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/symphonies-3-5-2011-by-hw-henze.html" rel="alternate" title="Symphonies 3-5 (2011) by H.W.

Hans Werner Henze: Symphony No. 3 (10/10)&lt;/h4&gt;Henze's third symphony starts off on a decidely pastoral note, before  sounding an ominous forboding about 15 seconds in. Though the first  notes might have convinced us this is something light and fluffy, we're  utterly relieved of that so quickly, it's almost impossible to belived.  In fact, the first movement ends up sounding more like a horror movie  soundtrack than traditional classical music. I suspect that a number of  major film composers leaned on Henze for their work. Henze employs all  sorts of modernist techniques to both the writing and the arrangement.&lt;br /&gt;The  second movement continues the downright ominous tone of the work,  though, as fitting traditional symphonic construction, the pace is much  slower. Again, the sound of that is some kind of demented horror movie.  It says a lot to me that the main way I can describe this is with  reference to a movie genre that barely existed at the time. I like how,  about 7 minutes in, the movement appears to come to its conclusion, but  no, it's just a diversion.&lt;br /&gt;The third movement continues the bonkers  modernism with nods to the second movement at the very least (I guess I  haven't listened to the whole thing enough to hear echoes of the first).  &lt;br /&gt;All in all, this has to be one of my favourite symphonies of the era. A true classic from an incredibly underrated composer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Ella Fitzgerald: &lt;i&gt;Ella Sings Gershwin&lt;/i&gt; (8/10)&lt;/h4&gt;Full disclosure: I don't like vocal jazz.&lt;br /&gt;However,  I listened to this because we are talking about one of the most famous  singers of the 20th century and I at least should be acquainted with  her. And after listening I can say I get what the hype is about but I  would rather hear her singing music that is at least a little more jazz.  I am not saying this isn't jazz; obviously it is. And it's brave, at  least in how bare it is. And I'd rather listen to these interpretations  of Gershwin than a lot of others. But, if you are like me and love jazz  for the thrill of hearing restless innovators trying to break  conventions, there is little of that here. I respect this, but I will  never love it.</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/422428067221967780/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=422428067221967780&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/422428067221967780" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/422428067221967780" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/1950-in-music.html" rel="alternate" title="1950 in Music" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-953363650536048510</id><published>2015-06-20T17:09:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-20T17:09:05.856-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2012"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Documentary"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Halloween"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Haunted House"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Movies"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Society"></category><title type="text">The American Scream (2012, Michael Stephenson)</title><content type="html">This is a fascinating movie about three families (really three men) who convert their houses into Haunted Houses every Halloween in Fairhaven, Mass.&lt;br /&gt;I don't know if there are places in Toronto, but I have never seen anything like in person, outside of professional Haunted Houses.

And that's all well and good - it's a correct thesis.

I give every album I review a minimum of three listens in order to defeat my initial prejudice. I adopted this approach, I think, because I wanted to be fair, but also because sometimes my initial impression did not jive with a review I read or a recommendation I received. And it's served me well, mostly. I would have never become a prog rock fan without the method, and that means I probably wouldn't have found my way to jazz and much of the other esoteric music I know and love.&lt;br /&gt;But I wonder if it serves me when I initial impression is to hate something. Because after three listens, I stop hating it (obviously - familiarity does not normally breed contempt between music and me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I must say, when I first listened to this (in 2015, because supposedly I heard it thrice long ago), I thought it was terrible.&lt;br /&gt;The opening to "Dance (Pt. 1)" reminds me of Flight of the Conchords. Seriously. And the rest of it sounds like the Stones trying and failing to do disco. The toasting doesn't help.&lt;br /&gt;"Summer Romance" is at least Stonesy. It's not memorable Stones, but it's at least not old guys trying to stay current.&lt;br /&gt;The lyrics to "Send it to Me" have the sophistication of a Backstreet Boys song ("I don't care who you are..."). In fact, many of Mick's lyrics are noticeably awful on this record. Usually I don't pay attention to Stones lyrics. But on this album, it's hard not to. This is them attempting reggae.&lt;br /&gt;"Let Me Go" is more traditional Stones but is even more forgettable than "Summer Romance."&lt;br /&gt;What I have long forgiven with "Brown Sugar" I have trouble forgiving with "Indian Girl." I appreciate the marimba and Nietzsche's kitschy mariachi "horns," but it feels like a bit of parody of their earlier, more successful stabs at country. Also, what the hell is it doing on this album? Those lyrics, man. Those lyrics...&lt;br /&gt;"Where the Boys Go" feels like the Stones' stab at punk. Jagger even adopts an accent! Who is doing that deep, growling? For a band that is often viewed as a source of punk, this is pretty weak. Perhaps it indicates that that is misplaced. It's super kitschy. I guess it's supposed to be a parody or something. Who the fuck knows. Drugs are bad.&lt;br /&gt;"Down in the Hole" is a slow soul number (or slow blues) featuring impassioned singing from Jagger and impassioned and excellent harmonica from someone other than Jagger. A blues musician I'd never heard of before. It's the best song here, I think. It's also utterly out of step with nearly everything else on the record.&lt;br /&gt;"Emotional Rescue" I know, of course. It's been played a ton. Jagger sings at the top of his range, let's commend him for that. It's odd that all the best or most famous songs are at the end of the record. Anyway, I've never been a fan of this. It does nothing for me.&lt;br /&gt;"She's So Cold" is probably the most famous song from the album. I like it more than the title track anyway. Just don't listen to the lyrics.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I'm a sucker for soul ballads, but Richards' "All About You" is practically the only thing I really, really like on this record. It has emotional resonance (shocking!) which I find lacking from everything else on the record.&lt;br /&gt;So though my now excessive familiarity has softened the album for me at least somewhat, I think I'm going to stick with my initial observation: this is a mess. It's half the band trying to expand its sound, like it supposedly did on &lt;i&gt;Some Girls&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Tattoo You&lt;/i&gt; (haven't heard either in a decade or more) and half stabs at classic Stones, but lacking the songs to back it up. And Jagger's lyrics are among the worst of his career. Basically it feels like an outtakes album when you know why the band left those tracks off their records.&lt;br /&gt;4/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/4358348398616567523/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=4358348398616567523&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/4358348398616567523" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/4358348398616567523" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/emotional-rescue-1980-by-rolling-stones.html" rel="alternate" title="Emotional Rescue (1980) by the Rolling Stones" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-5736893671571369155</id><published>2015-06-19T18:00:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-19T18:00:01.244-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1973"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1975"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Blues Rock"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Country Rock"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Music"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Pop Rock"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Rock"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Singer Songwriter"></category><title type="text">Tonight's the Night (1973, 1975) by Neil Young</title><content type="html">Neil Young was a star for the first time in 1973. And yet even though he was star, and he was expected to pump out further "Heart of Gold" style hits, his life was a mess. Whether or not he may acknowledge it now, he had drug issues. And within a rather short span of time, the rhythm guitarist for one of his bands died, and then a roadie died, both of heroin overdoses.&lt;br /&gt;And he was expected to keep playing "Heart of Gold" and writing more stuff like it. Instead he made this record. I can't remember why it wasn't released for 2 years. I've heard both the label and Young blamed for it. I don't know which to believe. The idea was it was un-releasable, as it consists of rough takes, most of which were recorded in a day. (Believe it or not, an &lt;i&gt;even&lt;/i&gt; more ragged version supposedly exists.)&lt;br /&gt;It's hard for us to look at a famous record like this and understand why there was fear (from either the artist or the label) to release it. We know it now. But this was before punk. There was pretty much no precedent for putting out something like this, certainly from a (now) major artist. The only precedent I can think of is &lt;i&gt;Get Back/Let it Be&lt;/i&gt;, and that was produced to death in order to hide the warts before it was finally made public. So we shouldn't be surprised that even though it may not sound rough to modern ears, it sure did in 1973. (&lt;i&gt;On the Beach&lt;/i&gt;, for example, sounds relatively polished comparatively.)&lt;br /&gt;Most of Young's songs capture not only his grief and confusion, but the huge amount of confusion that was being experienced culturally in the early to mid '70s, and the supposedly fulfilled American dream fell apart. Literally nobody else at the time was writing stuff like this. Dylan and Lennon were, but that was about personal demons. The exasperation with life in the US that is in these songs is kind of unparalleled at the time I think. And the aesthetic matches the sort of boozy, drugged "I can't tell if I'm happy, or sad, or just confused" vibe of the lyrics.&lt;br /&gt;Not my favourite Young record, but among the very best singer-songwriter records of the '70s, and probably ever.&lt;br /&gt;10/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/5736893671571369155/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=5736893671571369155&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/5736893671571369155" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/5736893671571369155" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/tonights-night-1973-1975-by-neil-young.html" rel="alternate" title="Tonight's the Night (1973, 1975) by Neil Young" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-4081431122255751762</id><published>2015-06-19T17:30:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-19T17:30:00.877-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1970"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Blues Rock"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Country"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Country Rock"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Folk"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Music"></category><title type="text">Workingman's Dead (1970) by the Grateful Dead</title><content type="html">If you had been aware of the Dead in Spring 1970 but you didn't live in San Francisco, you would have no way of knowing the band was birthed by a folk band in the mid '60s. If you caught them live, you would have been familiar with how they were the first ever jam band (though the name may not have existed yet) or if you listened to their albums, you would think they were by far the weirdest psychedelic band to emerge from San Francisco (unless you only heard their debut). You certainly wouldn't have guess they had country in them.&lt;br /&gt;With a classic record like this, it's hard for us to imagine what it was like &lt;i&gt;before &lt;/i&gt;the album came out, but seriously, who could have seen this coming? This is about as big a left turn as left turns got in 1970. Sure, the Byrds had already done it. And CSN (who apparently inspired this) did it, albeit in a different band. But The Byrds had always played folk songs, and included them even on their psychedelic releases. And Stills had played folk rock, and Crosby obviously did. There were precedents.&lt;br /&gt;I don't know what the precedent was for the Dead to go this far into country and folk. I really don't. Even if the album doesn't completely commit - even if there are a couple of songs recognizable as the old Dead.&lt;br /&gt;For me this works a lot better than CSN - the music doesn't feel like a new vehicle for pop. It feels like genuine country, folk and blues rock from a band that knows this music as well as anyone. And it further helps to have the lyrics written by a poet. They tend to do a better job than singers.&lt;br /&gt;An absolute classic.&lt;br /&gt;10/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/4081431122255751762/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=4081431122255751762&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/4081431122255751762" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/4081431122255751762" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/workingmans-dead-1970-by-grateful-dead.html" rel="alternate" title="Workingman's Dead (1970) by the Grateful Dead" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-143918235641200138</id><published>2015-06-19T17:00:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-19T17:00:03.087-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Basketball"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Hall of Fame"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="NBA"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Shawn Marion"></category><title type="text">Does Shawn Marion Belong in the Basketball Hall of Fame?</title><content type="html">Shawn Marion is retiring apparently.

That's absolutely true from an offensive perspective, but as Zach Lowe says, defence is half the game. We're just getting to the point where we might have some decent metrics for NBA defense, and Marion is just missing out. Had he been drafted 10 or 15 years years later, it's likely he would be appreciated even more than he already is.&lt;br /&gt;So that's the crux of the problem: we know Marion was an elite defensive player for over half a decade, perhaps more. One of the best at his position in the league, at times perhaps the very best. He was never a great offensive player, and his offense got worse in the playoffs (albeit for good reason, often guarding the other team's star or second best player, depending on positions). His one championship came closer to the end than the beginning, and by then he was not really his old self, which is why his role wasn't as important on those Mavs.&lt;br /&gt;But on the '06 Suns, you could argue he was even more important than Steve Nash, and that team changed the league and, without its bad luck, could have even won the championship (or at least made the final).&lt;br /&gt;I'm no NBA expert. I think Marion has a case, but I don't think he's a lock by any means based on current standards. And I think there are a lot of people who don't think he belongs simply because he was never remotely an elite offensive player. I think that's kind of stupid, but I cannot claim to know where he ranks among the best defenders ever. (Though it's worth noting that Basketball Reference's similarity score puts him right next to Pippen, so there's that.)&lt;br /&gt;So I don't know. A toss up, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/143918235641200138/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=143918235641200138&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/143918235641200138" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/143918235641200138" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/does-shawn-marion-belong-in-basketball.html" rel="alternate" title="Does Shawn Marion Belong in the Basketball Hall of Fame?" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-6859364823896982067</id><published>2015-06-18T20:45:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-18T20:52:04.698-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1955"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Melodrama"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Movies"></category><title type="text">All That Heaven Allows (1955, Douglas Sirk)</title><content type="html">Sometimes I feel like Sirk is the Norman Rockwell of old Hollywood: everything is so hyper-idealized. But I guess Winslow Homer is a better comparison, everything looks good, but things are lurking.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are all so intense and lightning is so dramatic. I know some people love Sirk for his sets and costumes and stuff. I've never been into that. I'm much more into the satire though, which is perhaps as as on display here as in any of Sirk's films. But it's kind of over the top, and honestly, things have changed so much since the '50s that it's really hard to relate to. Her friends are one thing, but her son is so unbelievably obnoxious I have trouble trying to imagine that would ever happen - this guy is supposed to be an adult? (But I'm probably not being fair.)&lt;br /&gt;So I struggle with this. I have a hard time understanding these people when they say things like "You love him so much you want to ruin all our lives?" Honestly, can I buy this? I have a really, really hard time. A really hard time. Maybe if the dialogue were a little different, a little more nuanced (but this is the play's fault I guess).&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate the attack on gossips and people of that ilk. But it's over the top, and, like all these melodramas that Sirk excels in, it's just too much for me, too much emoting and too much exaggerated color palette.&lt;br /&gt;7/10&lt;br /&gt;PS This woman's children are just horrible, horrible people. </content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/6859364823896982067/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=6859364823896982067&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/6859364823896982067" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/6859364823896982067" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/all-that-heaven-allows-1955-douglas-sirk.html" rel="alternate" title="All That Heaven Allows (1955, Douglas Sirk)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-3177780574442941888</id><published>2015-06-17T22:08:00.002-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-18T07:10:25.897-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2010"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Crime drama"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Docudrama"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Drama"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Movies"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="True Crime"></category><title type="text">All Good Things (2010, Andrew Jarecki)</title><content type="html">Now that &lt;i&gt;The Jinx&lt;/i&gt; exists, and I unfortunately know of the relationship between that show and this movie, it's kind of hard to think about this in isolation, but I will try.&lt;br /&gt;The film is very well acted: this is another one of those Gosling roles that he handles so well, even if, by this point, he's sort of been type cast as the conflicted, silent type; Dunst is also excellent.

(*In the NHL, the award is for the playoffs, not for the finals, as with the other major North American sports.)&lt;br /&gt;This is aparently not so in basketball, where only one man has ever won the Finals MVP from the losing side, Jerry West, the man known as Mr. Clutch, one of the worst nicknames in NBA history (given his teams' finals performances over the years). This was West's line when he won it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;43.9 MPG, 37.9PPG, 7.4APG, 4.7RPG, .490 FG% (steals and blocks were not tracked back then)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;That team featured Elgin Baylor and Wilt Chamberlain. Both were old and neither had a good series. But still. Elgin and Wilt were great players even when they weren't at their best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this Finals, as you all know, LeBron did the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;45.7 MPG, 35.8PPG, 13.3RPG, 8.8APG, 1.3SPG, .5BPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;.398 FG%, .310 3P%, .687 FT%, .477 TS%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;15.7 TRB%, &lt;b&gt;52.7 AST%!!!&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;40.8 USG%!!!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Yes, LeBron shot poorly. But he was the entire Cavs offence. Look at that assist percentage. Look at that usage rate. They're probably both historically great. LeBron didn't have Wilt or Elgin on his team, he had Tristan Thompson as the second best player. In Game 5 (I think it was), LeBron scored or assisted on something like 80% of the Cavs points.&lt;br /&gt;If MVP means the most important player on a team, as I believe it should (there is widespread disagreement), LeBron deserves this way more than anyone else on either team. &lt;a href="http://hardwoodparoxysm.com/2015/06/16/the-potential-historical-oddity-of-lebron-winning-finals-mvp/" target="_blank"&gt;As Hardwood Paroxysm noted the other day&lt;/a&gt;, if LeBron didn't win this MVP, that means that no player on the losing team in the finals can ever, ever win the MVP ever again. Ever. Seriously. What he did was historically great, as an individual performance. Jeff Van Gundy says he's never been more impressed by LeBron.&lt;br /&gt;The idea that Iggy (who I love, by the way) should win the MVP because he was on the winning team strikes me as preposterous as saying that the best player in the league in any year cannot win the MVP because his team doesn't make the playoffs (which is why I've long advocated for two separate awards, a 'best player' and a 'most valuable', ahem).&lt;br /&gt;(That being said, I am glad that Iggy won, because it shows a growing trend in recognizing defense in addition to offense. Peole will look at his line and say, "Well, Curry scored way more." But Curry didn't mitigate LeBron like Iggy did. Curry didn't change the fate of the Warriors when he was inserted into the starting lineup.)&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, consider this my non-official protest. The voters got it wrong. No matter how awkward it would have been to award it to a loser, LeBron deserved this MVP as much as any award he has ever won.</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/5489870091105893767/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=5489870091105893767&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/5489870091105893767" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/5489870091105893767" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/nba-finals-mvp-bull-shit.html" rel="alternate" title="NBA Finals MVP Bull Shit" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-2035063522096813492</id><published>2015-06-16T17:00:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-17T09:35:06.954-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Hall of Fame"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Hockey"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Kimmo Timonen"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="NHL"></category><title type="text">Does Kimmo Timonen Belong in the Hockey Hall of Fame?</title><content type="html">Based on the assumption that Timonen is retiring after his Cup win, I'm asking my usual question.

Timonen was drafted &lt;i&gt;250th&lt;/i&gt; overall.&amp;nbsp; He's a clear candidate for Finland's All Time team (and should make their Hall of Fame easily), and yet he could have quite easily not made the NHL if he'd had just a bit of bad luck.&lt;br /&gt;I'm glad he won a Cup. It's nice to see someone like this rewarded for his perserverence even if he didn't play very well in his final season.</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/2035063522096813492/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=2035063522096813492&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/2035063522096813492" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/2035063522096813492" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/does-kimmo-timonen-belong-in-hockey.html" rel="alternate" title="Does Kimmo Timonen Belong in the Hockey Hall of Fame?" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-3578725022204250984</id><published>2015-06-15T20:35:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-15T20:35:45.395-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1962"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Drama"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Movies"></category><title type="text">All Fall Down (1962, John Frankenheimer)</title><content type="html">This film is one of those over-baked Tennessee Williams-esque portraits of a family barely keeping it together, with an over-bearing mother (naturally), a drunk father (naturally) and a golden boy who isn't quite so golden (naturally). We've seen this before, even if the story isn't quite the same. Beatty seems to be doing a James Dean impersonation (well, maybe that's not fair), Angela Lansbury is in full blown mother mode (though not at &lt;i&gt;The Manchurian Candidate&lt;/i&gt; level, and in this case she's got a drunk husband that makes her much more sympathetic) and Karl Malden is doing a thing that I've seen him do in some other movie too (though I can't remember it right now, and it might have been a later movie).&lt;br /&gt;(Just a note of complaint: I don't know why the novelist named Beatty's character Berry-Berry, but why they have to say that name over and over, I don't know...) &lt;br /&gt;(Mild spoiler alert.)&lt;br /&gt;What takes the family from struggling along to falling down (sorry) is not unusual. What did the old, angry men used to say? 'Evil, they name is woman?' (It might have been frailty...) Well, surprise, surprise. Eva Marie Saint comes along stirs up shit.&lt;br /&gt;However, the one advantage this film has over a lot of others of its type is Frankenheimer's bonkers direction. The angles are often zany and some of the shots are really whacky. The film features more location shooting than many movies of its vintage and the house &lt;i&gt;feels&lt;/i&gt; like a house (which can't be said for so many sound stages). Oh yeah, and shaky cameras! Holy shit! It's like Frankenheimer was watching a lot of old German films or maybe some French New Wave stuff.&lt;br /&gt;It's worth watching if you're a Frankenheimer of if you're just a film history fan interested in the pushing and prodding against the Hollywood system that was going on just before the dam broke.&lt;br /&gt;7/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/3578725022204250984/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=3578725022204250984&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/3578725022204250984" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/3578725022204250984" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/all-fall-down-1962-john-frankenheimer.html" rel="alternate" title="All Fall Down (1962, John Frankenheimer)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-9013164456039969387</id><published>2015-06-15T17:30:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-15T17:30:00.116-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2007"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Alternative"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Alternative Rock"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Music"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Post Grunge"></category><title type="text">The Alchemy Index: Volume III and Volume IV - Air and Earth (2007) by Thrice</title><content type="html">Unfortunately Volume III takes the brief moments of Volume II that alluded to a sort of Post Grunge / "Modern" rock style and takes them to the logical conclusion. I guess some people would consider these songs "stronger" - they're certainly catchier - by why neuter what your band does well? At least the rhythm section is way better than your standard everyday rock band. It's certainly a bit of a departure from what I thought this band sounded like, and I guess that's fine if you like ballads and stuff. I feel like I'm being too hard on it. This is certainly more creative than the sounds of it suggests it would be. So that's something. And I guess it's a reasonably cohesive whole.&lt;br /&gt;Volume IV is, to me, where the idea of disparate EPs falls apart. And where I really start wondering why not release just a conventional double album? (Or, better yet, why not edit yourselves further and created a one disc record?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first song of the last record sounds like you're getting into a folk thing (albeit filtered through a 21st century rock fan's concept of what folk sounds like, i.e. not very traditional). Frankly it's more like "acoustic rock." And it's hard to differentiate it that much from Volume III, beyond obvious volume (yuk yuk yuk) differences. I kept wanting the Post Hardcore band to kick in.&lt;br /&gt;The second track feels like it's going for more of a Tom Waits-in-the-70s vibe, albeit with a shittier piano, and backing vocals (and lacking the distinct lead vocal, obviously). The song is among their best (that I've heard), but that's not really the point. It adds to the "Odds and Ends" feel of this volume.&lt;br /&gt;By the third track "the acoustic rock" has resumed, albeit a sort of artier vesion this time. It's another strong song. But it sounds like the kind of thing that would be on a "Hey, look we've gone acoustic for a moment" EP like bands used to do.&lt;br /&gt;The fourth track is another piano-led number, but with a different feel (can't place it right now), that same shitty piano, and this time what sounds like a digital choir.&lt;br /&gt;The fifth track is exemplary of the kind of "folk" music filtered through the lens of the last few decades of alternative rock. It's obvious they are trying for a folk feel (based on the lyrics), but the music and the instruments chosen to perform it say "rock" (and, also, blues rock, but again blues rock by musicians who don't really get the blues).&lt;br /&gt;And the last track is just ruined by the gang vocals (and some shitty lyrics).&lt;br /&gt;Why do I harp on all of this? Well, instead of forcing these themed "EPs" which aren't that unified, why not just take the best songs you recorded and release a record? And if you want a loose concept, sure, insist on it in the liner notes. Whatever. But is this elaborate presentation necessary? And was there enough quality to sustain it? I don't think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/9013164456039969387/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=9013164456039969387&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/9013164456039969387" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/9013164456039969387" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-alchemy-index-volume-iii-and-volume.html" rel="alternate" title="The Alchemy Index: Volume III and Volume IV - Air and Earth (2007) by Thrice" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-7542434061992662386</id><published>2015-06-15T17:00:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-15T17:00:01.565-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2007"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Art Rock"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Metalcore"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Music"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Post Hardcore"></category><title type="text">The Alchemy Index: Volume II - Water (2007) by Thrice</title><content type="html">Unfortunately I have not been able to hear Volume I so this review is only of Volume II.&lt;br /&gt;It's a tough call though, because ostensibly, a lot of the appeal of this, and the reason the discs are separate even though they don't have to be, is for stylistic reasons. So without hearing Volume I, I cannot comment as to how Volume II diverges.&lt;br /&gt;And that's a problem, because Volume II is basically just somewhat commercial Post Hardcore. It's hard to get excited about it. When reviewing another one of these bands a few years ago, I worried that Post Hardcore was becoming sort of a more indie version of what Post Grunge became back in the '90s, and at least a little of this makes me worry about that (the wordlress choruses).&lt;br /&gt;But there's enough anger here to save it from that fate, I guess.

As usual, I cannot know whether or not that was in the source material, but it's supposedly been 3 years in Narnia time, and yet everyone has drastically changed dress - minus the non-existence of gun powder, it's as if the story has moved to the Age of Exploration, i.e. the age of pirates. And that doesn't fly with me.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I have to hand it to Lewis to keep mining different areas of human history and mythology for new adventures, but the problem is that the mythology of his world changes with every story. What &lt;i&gt;Potter&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;GoT&lt;/i&gt; have clearly spoiled for me are self-contained worlds where the background mythology gets deeper but never (or rarely) contradicts itself, which really doesn't feel that way in this series. It's pretty hard to imagine how the world of the &lt;i&gt;Dawn Treader&lt;/i&gt; could really be the world of &lt;i&gt;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the Catholic thing is the least subtle in this film.

Like many movies I saw in parts on TV when I was younger, I rated it without watching the entire thing. So I guess I'm making up for that.&lt;br /&gt;This was the only fantasy book I "read" as a child. (It was &lt;i&gt;read&lt;/i&gt; to me, as I was that young.) Perhaps this explains my dislike of most fantasy. I experienced so little as a child that, as a teen and an adult, I found so much of it ridiculous because I wasn't raised on it. Anyway, to the movie itself (SPOILERS):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can't say that the adaptation is necessarily bad (from what I remember) though the CGI has dated rather poorly in some instances (not so much the animals, but the green screens, and some other things) and it's fairly obvious that this film was not awarded the type of budget that &lt;i&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/i&gt; was.&lt;br /&gt;But the budget isn't the problem. The problem is the source material. For kids, this is gripping. I still remember the general story to this day, and I remember being utterly captivated as a child. But as an adult, it is boring - there are literally &lt;i&gt;zero&lt;/i&gt; stakes for us. Nobody good can die - everyone who does comes back - and so there is &lt;i&gt;literally no risk&lt;/i&gt; for anyone, despite what the actors (real and voice) try to convey. The advantage &lt;i&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/i&gt; has over this is threefold: first, its spread out over so many films that there is no easy resolution as with this film; second, major characters do indeed die; third, there are betrayals and whatever the opposite of betrayals are - you don't always know who's on which side. That's to say, there's drama (in the narrative sense, not in the colloquial sense). And there isn't really very much of that in this movie, unless you're a kid.&lt;br /&gt;I stand by my initial rating, even if I didn't watch the whole movie (or even most of it) the first time.&lt;br /&gt;5/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/6347521698257148304/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=6347521698257148304&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/6347521698257148304" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/6347521698257148304" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-chronicles-of-narnia-lion-th-witch.html" rel="alternate" title="The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, th Witch and the Warddrobe (2005, Andrew Adamson)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-2735350579796911739</id><published>2015-06-14T12:00:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-14T12:00:56.802-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2001"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Fantasy"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Movies"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Romantic Comedy"></category><title type="text">Amelie (2001, Jean-Pierre Jeunet)</title><content type="html">I don't know why it took me so long to see this movie. I'm a pretty big Jeunet fan, but whatever interest I had in seeing it at the time soon waned. No idea why. For some reason I anticipated I wouldn't like it, which seems odd to me.&lt;br /&gt;It's way less out there than &lt;i&gt;Delicatessen&lt;/i&gt; (still my favourite) or &lt;i&gt;The City of Lost Children&lt;/i&gt;, and significantly more accessible, but what it lacks in utter uniqueness it makes up in charm. It reminds me of &lt;i&gt;Leolo&lt;/i&gt; to a great extent, but a little zanier if that's possible.&lt;br /&gt;This is how you do whimsy. So few American filmmakers seem to be able to do it, for some reason. (Perhaps, because for them, whimsy always has to be childish or family-oriented.)&lt;br /&gt;Though it is significantly less daring than his earlier films I still found myself utterly carried away by the film, its inventiveness, and, as usual, Jeunet's inimitable style. Also, I laughed almost constantly, which is something I can't say for the vast majority of romantic comedies that are made in English.&lt;br /&gt;A wonderful film.&lt;br /&gt;9/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/2735350579796911739/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=2735350579796911739&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/2735350579796911739" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/2735350579796911739" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/amelie-2001-jean-pierre-jeunet.html" rel="alternate" title="Amelie (2001, Jean-Pierre Jeunet)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-2560049073247839283</id><published>2015-06-13T20:21:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-13T20:21:26.431-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2009"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Action"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Comic Book"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Movies"></category><title type="text">Watchmen (2009, Zack Snyder)</title><content type="html">This is an admirable, ambitious attempt to adapt what is, for many people, The Greatest Comic of All Time. (I know others prefer some other comics, but I know that this was the first comic given serious treatment as literature by non-comic book fans.) I was mostly impressed by the attempts at fidelity and the attempts at balancing the film medium with a story that is perhaps just a little too complex for a feature.&lt;br /&gt;Two major things that I think didn't work well enough: First, is Snyder himself. Unsurprisingly, he tries to make some scenes resemble the actual panels in the comic (he apparently story-boarded it from the comic) and while that would admirable if he had committed to it entirely, he didn't. I say either go full &lt;i&gt;Sin City&lt;/i&gt; or make a conventional movie. One or the other. Don't try to hybrid it. Snyder's style also doesn't really suit the material. I think a better director might have made this closer to a classic. But...&lt;br /&gt;Second, frankly I think a proper adaptation of &lt;i&gt;Watchmen&lt;/i&gt; in this day and age might have been on TV. There's just too much. An 8- or 10-episode miniseries for a prestige channel such as HBO would have been far easier for the average viewer (who hasn't read it) to digest and wouldn't have had to omit so much from the story. Apparently there's a longer cut available, but I'd rather see a more complete film that I didn't have to buy a special DVD to see.&lt;br /&gt;(One positive: I think the change of the ending is perhaps well-suited to the film.)&lt;br /&gt;But all this being said, I kind of have to say that this is pretty successful as these things go, and I think it is the material itself that prevented it from being a hit (which is really too bad). People just don't like difficult stuff. It's incredible to me that everyone would rather watch &lt;i&gt;The Avengers&lt;/i&gt; than something like this, but that's how it's always going to be.&lt;br /&gt;7/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/2560049073247839283/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=2560049073247839283&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/2560049073247839283" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/2560049073247839283" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/watchmen-2009-zack-snyder.html" rel="alternate" title="Watchmen (2009, Zack Snyder)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-2804893655742199917</id><published>2015-06-13T16:47:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-13T16:47:15.705-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2006"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Horror"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Movies"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Slasher"></category><title type="text">All the Boys Love Mandy Lane (2006, Jonathan Levine)</title><content type="html">I watched the first 30-35 minutes of this maybe a year ago (in pieces) while someone else was watching it. I figured I should watch it all the way through, even given my reservations.&lt;br /&gt;My reservations were a few:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I didn't go to a school like this. I guess there were one or two girls as attractive as Amber Heard, but did the boys really behave this way around her? Maybe, I don't think so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Not being cool, I didn't go to parties or go to weekends away, but was everyone this sex obsessed? I mean, it wasn't even this bad at my university. (What I mean is the nakedness of the sexual ambition, not necessarily the obsession with sex. Were people this obvious and this 'cut to the chase' in your experience?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And I know teenaged boys are assholes, but these teenaged boys are the worst. It would be nice if they all...oh wait.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Before I get to that, it's kind of bonkers that this film received a theatrical release something like 7 years after it premiered.&lt;br /&gt;(SPOILERS)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But anyway...&lt;br /&gt;Though this is a serious attempt at reviving classic slashers, there's so much of it the rubs me the wrong way. Like, when Garth sees the girl's boobs - if I were Garth I'd be getting the hell out of there. I know the actress was 24, but as an adult man, the last thing you want to do is be near teenage girls who're taking their clothes off. But anyway...&lt;br /&gt;Then there's the stupid bathroom near-lesbian stuff, which is the kind of thing only man would write. But anyway...&lt;br /&gt;Be careful with that knife, you'll cut your eyes out. Ahem. There's never any character development for killers, you know? And revealing a killer well before the half way mark is kind of stupid. It's a rule that I think the vast majority of horror movies don't follow. Even when they do follow it, sometimes they still screw it up, but in a movie like this, it's pretty frustrating because there's nothing else to hold our interest after the killer is revealed, beyond "how will everyone die?"&lt;br /&gt;And the next day, it becomes an altogether different kind of movie, not a slasher-style film, but almost...well, I can see the comparison to &lt;i&gt;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&lt;/i&gt;, even if I don't agree with it. But all the bodies are conveniently located so that the fleeing victims stumble upon them, as if he would have known. There are moments where they attempt to inject comedy, but that feels remarkably odd given the otherwise dour tone once the next day begins.&lt;br /&gt;And even when the big twist comes, we still don't really get any character development, but at least Emmett gets to first (second?) base before he dies.&lt;br /&gt;But anyway...&lt;br /&gt;Yay, torture porn.&lt;br /&gt;4/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/2804893655742199917/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=2804893655742199917&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/2804893655742199917" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/2804893655742199917" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/all-boys-love-mandy-lane-2006-jonathan.html" rel="alternate" title="All the Boys Love Mandy Lane (2006, Jonathan Levine)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-7621322667592810166</id><published>2015-06-13T10:38:00.002-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-13T10:38:48.100-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1935"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Comedy"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Drama"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Movies"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Romance"></category><title type="text">Alice Adams (1935, George Stevens)</title><content type="html">I haven't read this particular Tarkington novel but I've read another and I can't say I liked it. If the book was effective, the filmmakers messed up. Alice and her family certainly doesn't look poor: they have a large house (which she says is small) and what looks like nice things. I guess they sort of sound lower in the classes, but barely. They certainly aren't poor. And it doesn't help that they cast Hepburn, who of course looks wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;The comedy is really mild and sporadic. Seemingly placed in the film just to give the audience something other than the romance to focus on. And of course most of it is really dated; the slapstick works some but most of the verbal jokes no longer register as jokes. The best joke is when Hepburn is swooning on the porch and her character's mother turns off the bad Hollywood score. &lt;br /&gt;I will say that the dinner where Alice tries pretend she's rich is awkward effective, more than the rest of the film.&lt;br /&gt;And backing dramatic conflict is sorted out so easily, which is just typical of these old Hollywood films (and maybe these old American books too).&lt;br /&gt;And romantic drama is sorted out even easier with no real actual concern for the supposed problem of his engagement. Who the hell knows what to say about stuff like that?&lt;br /&gt;Ugh, "classic" Hollywood.

I hate when filmmakers involve themselves in their subjects when they themselves are not who we are interested in. But once Bulger gets to Baker's house, he gets out of the way almost entirely. Baker is such a character - and his story and his family's story is so compelling - that you quickly forget about how Bulger involved himself in the early parts of the film.&lt;br /&gt;The animation is pointless in my mind but otherwise the film is structured chronologically which is so refreshing given the desire of so many documentaries and docudramas to move beyond that. It's affecting and amusing. It also makes me want to revisit what I think of Baker as a drummer&lt;br /&gt;Despite the opening, which kind of sucks, this is a pretty great portrait of a extremely talented but flawed man and his affect on music.

Sure, it's a very different approach to a film about war, but that in and of itself doesn't make it great. Some people just love simple stories I guess. the grandmother visits, makes everyone happy and leaves. That's enough for some people I guess. Not me.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, if you can't sit through something like this, I feel bad for you.

Initially, this was just in the solos, deviating from the conventions of the genre which said you had to stay in certain ranges and keys during your solo. Coleman's early quartet, fearturing him on alto (a plastic one!), Don Cherry on trumpet, Charlie Haden on bass and Billy Higgins on drums. Jazz history says these guys invented free jazz in 1959: they had no piano and the soloists improvised outside of conventional jazz logic. (Coleman's few efforts before this quartet were a little more traditional.) I don't know that it's entirely true that they invented the genre - efforts towards freer music had been made since the late '40s, but nobody had really put it altogether prior to this band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you listen to &lt;i&gt;The Shape of Jazz to Come&lt;/i&gt; now, it doesn't really sound like free has for decades - it sounds relatively conventional - and that's because it was an initial step. Coleman and others went way farther afield soon after and now free jazz is essentially just free improvisation: doing whatever you want to do. Sometimes it works, oftentimes it doesn't. Coleman's initial band was still operating with some structure.&lt;br /&gt;For me personally, Coleman's early music was some of the first free I ever listened to (along with Coltrane's) and he helped knock down the few remaining walls I had in terms of deciding what was and wasn't music. After listening to even early Coleman, it became harder and harder to label some things noise and other things music. Sure, there were other bands that helped me along this path (and within jazz it was Albert Ayler probably most of all, that taught me what can be considered music) but Coleman showed me how an artist could both break rules and maintain others at the same time, and how that is often more beautiful (and successful) than breaking as many rules as possible. To this day, my a favourite "post free" (music made in the shadow of the free jazz revoluation, for lack of a better term) music both breaks with and honours tradition, and that is something I think Coleman did, at least initially.&lt;br /&gt;He was one of the most important figures in jazz in the second half of the 20th century (behind Davis, Mingus, Trane and maybe nobody else) and he opened so many doors for other people, it's hard overstate his influence. &lt;br /&gt;I'm sorry what I have to say is inadequate. He will be missed.</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/2702363082632628383/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=2702363082632628383&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/2702363082632628383" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/2702363082632628383" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/rip-ornette-coleman.html" rel="alternate" title="RIP Ornette Coleman" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-4512162387273227275</id><published>2015-06-10T18:00:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-10T18:00:03.948-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2005"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Atmospheric Sludge Metal"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Math Rock"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Metalcore"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Music"></category><title type="text">Chronoclast (2005) by Buried Inside</title><content type="html">Like math rock mixed with and metalcore.

Well, here goes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is the second "classic" hip hop record I've ever given my requisite 3 listens. However, unlike the one Public Enemy record I've now heard, I can't just accept it for what it is. Because, unlike that record, and like so much of hip hop (far as I know), this is something that is utterly full of contradictions. And I'm not sure what I think of those. I know that's deliberate - it is, I suppose, one of the things that makes Hip Hop so appealing to so many people - but that doesn't mean I necessarily like it, as I listen to music for the music, not for the theatre...well, most of the time. Certainly that's one of the barriers that still exists for me when I try to review these things.&lt;br /&gt;I was going to write something long about trying to reconcile the various characters or personalities I think Ice Cube inhabits on this record, and try to reconcile my appreciation of the Bomb Squad's participation (they make everything better, clearly) and Ice Cube's moments of social comment with the ridiuculous, over the top misogyny and the braggadacio that I will never, ever, ever understand. But instead, I guess I'll just go through the tracks and try to assess them, and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;The opening skit is ridiculous. I understand that growing up where he grew up necessitates thick skin and acting as if you're tough, but pretending you know how you're going to be when you're faced with execution (from The Man, no less) is stupid and phony. I get it, you're a scary motherfucker.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I can't even imagine the balls it takes to have a hook that says "Fuck You Ice Cube." And whatever I may think of the lyrics, the production is great.&lt;br /&gt;The title track is also a typically dense Bomb Squad production. But this braggadacio does nothing for me. I guess it should give me a portrait into a life I've never known (and will never know) but I'm not sure I give a shit. But there's a little social comment to it, so that's something.&lt;br /&gt;"What They Hittin' Foe?" is apparently about a dice game gone wrong. Again, though I might appreciate the Bomb Squad's production, and I might respect Ice Cube's rapping ability (I really have no idea how he compares to anyone else, but he sounds good), I listen to music for music, not for sociology.&lt;br /&gt;"You Can't Fade Me" might be the most misogynist thing I've ever listened to. And this raises the thing that sort of hovers in my mind throughout the albume: is he being genuine here, or is this a character? I would say he's not playing a character, as he refers to himself by his stage name, but maybe it's just a side of his personality? I was just watching a (not very good) documentary about Mike Tyson and Tupac and someone was arguing that Tupac was both misogynyst and relatively feminist at the same time. When you compare this track to "It's a Man's World," you want to think the same thing about Ice Cube. But who knows? I certainly would not choose to listen to something like this on my own. As I always say in defence of &lt;i&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/i&gt; scenes, depicting isn't condoning. But I'm honestly not sure what he's doing here.&lt;br /&gt;I guess the "Gafflin'" thing is making fun of us white people. Is the laughter supposed to make me want to find it funny? (Skits on music albums will never make sense to me.)&lt;br /&gt;At least I feel like "Once Upon a Time in the Projects" is a little more social comment-ish.&lt;br /&gt;I like "Turn Off hte Radio"! Amen man.&lt;br /&gt;"Endangered Species" is one of the powerful tracks on the record, and it's something I can respect, even if doesn't do much for me musically (beyond respect for the production).&lt;br /&gt;I find "A Gangsta's Fairytale" to be rather hilarious. I get what he's trying to say, but exaggerating (which I assume he's doing, but maybe I'm wrong) doesn't convince me. A little subtlety might have served him here. But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it is good social comment and I'm just thoroughly ignorant of what it was like in Compton in the 1980s. It's probably the latter, honestly.&lt;br /&gt;I could do without "I'm Only Out for One Thang."&lt;br /&gt;The next track appears to be Hip Hop's answer to songs about groupies. It's a lot more complicated than the old rock songs about groupies, so that's good.&lt;br /&gt;Then there's another skit about how dangerous things are, or whatever. And it didn't make much of an impression on me until the Brokaw quote.&lt;br /&gt;"Rollin' wit the Lench Mob" prompts me to realize that there is a lot going on in the lyrics, and maybe they deserve more thought than I give them. I mean this is braggadacio, but it seems to be some purpose (whatever that is). And that's probably true of the all that stuff on here. Though some of it just comes off as "holy shit I'm so tough, watch out" which is the kind of thing which makes me not care at all about hip hop.&lt;br /&gt;I had to look up Mack on urban dictionary. Yes, I'm that white. But it's interesting in that his contradictions re: women seem fully on display here.&lt;br /&gt;"It's a Man's World" almost redeems "You Can't Fade Me." It would have completely if they had picked a different song for the hook. It's incredible that the two tracks are on the same album and I will spend ages trying to figure out how. I'm someone who's obsessed with intellectual consistency, and so stuff like this drives me crazy. But good for him for promoting a woman rapper.&lt;br /&gt;"The Bomb" is on the stronger side as well.&lt;br /&gt;Listen, this is art. It's obviously art. It's just art designed for a particular set of people, or so I would have thought. I get the popularity of Public Enemy. I have a harder time getting the popularity (among suburban white kids) of something like this. And just because it's art doesn't mean I have to like it. (Though I respect it, at least some of it.)&lt;br /&gt;7/10 </content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/7203768894813005815/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=7203768894813005815&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/7203768894813005815" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/7203768894813005815" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/amerikkkas-most-wanted-1990-by-ice-cube.html" rel="alternate" title="AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted (1990) by Ice Cube" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-6125978175334954877</id><published>2015-06-10T17:00:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-11T10:16:33.708-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1985"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Music"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Pop Rock"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Pub Rock"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Second Wave New Wave"></category><title type="text">Brothers in Arms (1985) by Dire Straits</title><content type="html">Ten years ago I wrote the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This might not be so bad if they had actually hired a producer.&amp;nbsp; It's like Knopfler put a big stamp on this record saying "This album was recorded in the '80s!"&amp;nbsp; Knopfler's production is the aural equivalent of those '50s sci-fi films that imagined the "futuristic" '70s and now make us laugh...oh how silly they were to think that's what the future would look like, te he he.&amp;nbsp; They tried to make this sound "modern" and hear what happened.&amp;nbsp; His songs aren't all mediocre.&amp;nbsp; "Money for Nothing," aside from having one of the classic guitar licks from the '80s, is a pretty good attempt at replicating what regular joes probably felt when looking at synth pop/"hair metal" bands on MTV.&amp;nbsp; "Walk of Life" and "So Far Away" would have been decent without the "Hey, did we mention it's '85?" production.&amp;nbsp; However, "Your Latest Trick" is about as bad as pop music posing as "fusion" gets.&amp;nbsp; Something else might've resulted had they actually found someone who can make records.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was the last time I listened to this record - the only Dire Straits record I have ever heard, until the last week or so. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I like Knopfler as a songwriter. I like a lot of his lyrics (though not all): for example, despite being overplayed, I think the lyrics to "Money for Nothing" are pretty great. I think there is probably an incredible cover of "Your Latest Trick" out there which reveals it as an absolutely classic song. That might be true of some of the other songs here as well.&lt;br /&gt;And Knopfler is a distinct guitar player. I have always loved "Sultans of Swing" (the only Dire Straits song I really know well) because of his playing. And I admire his ability to pay in a style all his own, completely divorced from what was going on in contemporary music.&lt;br /&gt;I suspect I would like an album of Mark Knopfler songs and guitar playing, in certain circumstances. I think maybe this means I should check out his solo career, or perhaps Dire Straits albums that weren't made to sound "contemporary."&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes, embracing new technology is a great thing. Like with 8- and 16-track recording. That led to lots of great new music (and some terrible music). But the technological innovations of the late '70s and most of the '80s have been employed, for the most part, for Evil. &lt;br /&gt;I don't think it's hypocritical for me to praise Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins for inventing the bad '80s drum sound in 1980 (when it really was innovative) and attack this album for using too much bad '80s drum sound in 1985.&lt;br /&gt;And it's not just the bad '80s drums (which really aren't used &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; much). It's the bad '80s keyboards (present on nearly every song). And particularly it's the bad '80s saxophone on "Your Latest Trick." These things make me want to kill somebody. (Phil Collins?)&lt;br /&gt;And that's too bad, as Knopfler is probably the 4th best Pub Rock / British New Wave songwriter ever (after Costello, Lowe and Sting) and he's a hell of a unique player. And I want to like him.&lt;br /&gt;I've bumped up my 10-year old review by one star, because this isn't terrible. Strong songs and playing distorted by terrible production are still strong songs and playing.&lt;br /&gt;6/10 </content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/6125978175334954877/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=6125978175334954877&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/6125978175334954877" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/6125978175334954877" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/brothers-in-arms-1985-by-dire-straits.html" rel="alternate" title="Brothers in Arms (1985) by Dire Straits" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-1734834644711782512</id><published>2015-06-09T21:41:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-09T21:41:12.460-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2011"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Drama"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Historical Drama"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Movies"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Period"></category><title type="text">Albert Nobbs (2011, Rodrigo Garcia)</title><content type="html">This is an interesting film centered on a bravura performance from Glenn Close.

Though one of the original post punk bands (perhaps, because of this), they are considerably more accessible than the other post-punk bands. And at least on this album, considerably closer to punk. They sort of strike me as more American-style New Wave than their British Post Punk contemporaries.&lt;br /&gt;And that's why I don't think this is quite as amazing as I want it to be. I mean, I like the songs a lot - they do a lot better job of writing catchy songs than most other British Post Punk bands - but there were a number of other Post Punk bands making much more daring music at the same time.

They had a good thing going, those Genesis guys...and while I know that version of the band could never have topped &lt;i&gt;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&lt;/i&gt;, neither Gabriel nor the rest of the band ever demonstrated that kind of creativity again.  That being said, this record is fine.  There are some fine moments.  However, the "world music" feels almost flown in compared to everything else.  Both Bowie and the Discipline version of Crimson do aspects of this better.  I will probably like it more in time.  but it just seems somewhat underwhelming at this point.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I continue to struggle with this record, but not so much because of the production. I now recognize the production for what it is: extremely innovative for the time (the cymbal-less drums, the gated drums, the early use of drum machines and brand new synthesizers, the use of world music instruments and ideas in the arrangements). Saying this is "too much like 1980" was kind of disingenious of me, because the 1980s owes this record so much.&lt;br /&gt;My problem is more with the set of songs. I like some of the lyrics but I dislike others. I find most of the songs feel almost pieced togehther (which may have been the point) where a chorus or a bridge feels completely (or nearly) divorced from a verse. And that, masked in the overly "modernist" production always rubbed me the wrong way enough for me to ignore the things I did like: the presence of Fripp, the bonkers xylophone solo on "Intruder" (and the marimbas - credited as xylophone but certainly they sound like wood - on "No Self Control") and other tricks.&lt;br /&gt;Really, the whole things is so shocking/daring for mainstream pop music. But the combination of Gabriel not sounding like (1974 era) Genesis and writing catchy songs that were weird but somehow both too weird and not weird enough for me really caused me to denigrate this a little.&lt;br /&gt;And I think I've been really wrong about that for the last seven and a half years. It took me a really long time, but I think I've come around to the idea that this is a brave, bold, innovative record - a near masterpiece that would have been better only if it didn't have that terrible '80s saxophone (which it likely birthed as well) on "Start." (I exaggerate slightly.)&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong. I'm sorry.&lt;br /&gt;9/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/5172668461767216469/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=5172668461767216469&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/5172668461767216469" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/5172668461767216469" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/peter-gabriel-melt-1980.html" rel="alternate" title="Peter Gabriel [Melt] (1980)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-6644073502842385629</id><published>2015-06-09T17:00:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-09T17:00:00.659-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1980"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Music"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Psychobilly"></category><title type="text">Songs the Lord Taught Us (1980) by the Cramps</title><content type="html">I always thought the Cramps invented Psychobilly. But I was reading an [i]AV Club[/i] primer the other month and it implied that the Cramps are not pure enough to really be Psychobilly, i.e. they're too diverse. I find this extraordinarily odd. Not only did the writer (and presumably other people) believe that the Cramps are diverse, but he seemed to believe (along with others) that the best Psychobilly is even less diverse than this record. Bizarre, no?&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, let's just pretend/assume they did invent Psychobilly. To the best of my knowledge, their approach was pretty unique at the time: way more rockabilly influenced than any other contemporary punk band, but with enough punk (and glam) influences to very distinguishable from the rockabilly revival that emerged after the first wave of punk. Far as I know, what they did here was utterly unique: rockabilly paired with punk and glam, and lyrics from horror movies. They created something utterly unique (again, to the best of my knowledge). And that's why this record should be celebrated. That, and if you cared to, you can dance to it.&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is one of my favourite album titles of all time.&lt;br /&gt;9/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/6644073502842385629/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=6644073502842385629&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/6644073502842385629" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/6644073502842385629" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/songs-lord-taught-us-1980-by-cramps.html" rel="alternate" title="Songs the Lord Taught Us (1980) by the Cramps" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-6850566368628408613</id><published>2015-06-08T21:22:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-08T21:22:17.250-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2009"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Coming of Age"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Movies"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Nature"></category><title type="text">Alamar (2009, Pedro Gonzalez-Rubio)</title><content type="html">&lt;i&gt;Alamar&lt;/i&gt; is a nature film posing as a coming of age "drama" (I used the word loosely). Set primarily on (and off) &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Chinchorro" target="_blank"&gt;an island off of Mexico&lt;/a&gt;, the film uses the vacation a boy experiences with his father one summer (his parents are separated or divorced) to show both the beauty of the place and way of life of the few residents. It's an interesting concept (and a pretty novel one, I think) but it's one that I think most people (myself included) have to be in the right mood for in order to fully appreciate. The backstory is told well: via cellphone video and then postcards, we learn very quickly that the couple are separated. However, once the boy arrives in Mexico to spend time with his father, whatever story there is goes out the window. I don't have a problem with that but you feel the film's length, and it's not a very long movie. I was captivated by the place - I would love to go there - and everything about the father son relationship felt real. But I spent the entire movie waiting for something to happen; perhaps that's just because of the mood I was in. It's a pretty film and a neat idea, but you must be prepared for virtually no story, and basically just treat it as a nature film with a very loose narrative tacked on to it.&lt;br /&gt;7/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/6850566368628408613/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=6850566368628408613&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/6850566368628408613" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/6850566368628408613" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/alamar-2009-pedro-gonzalez-rubio.html" rel="alternate" title="Alamar (2009, Pedro Gonzalez-Rubio)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-5295584810566376885</id><published>2015-06-07T19:22:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-07T19:29:30.329-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2011"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Drama"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Movies"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Romance"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Soft Science Fiction"></category><title type="text">The Adjustment Bureau (2011, George Nolfi)</title><content type="html">&lt;i&gt;I guess there are some SPOILERS!&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Imagine you're marketing a movie in the early 2010s. It's a science fiction cum romance disguised political drama or thriller. But it has the advantage of starring Matt Damon, one of the world's biggest movie stars of the era. It also stars Emily Blunt, an up and coming female star. So you give it a title and say 'Hey check out this new political mystery/romance with Matt Damon and Emily Blunt." Wouldn't that be enough? Then, when the rather awkward science fiction twist that comes very early in the first act would be a surprise instead of something &lt;i&gt;given away by the title of the film&lt;/i&gt;. Now, apparently this is based on a Phillip K. Dick story with a very similar title. I can't speak to whether or not that story is effective, but this movie tries to sell you on the idea that everything is normal before the awkward reveal, only for the audience to know what the awkward reveal is, essentially, because of the goddamned &lt;i&gt;title of the movie&lt;/i&gt;. Okay, I'll stop.&lt;br /&gt;But the reason I harp on this is because this film has way too much expository telling (that's a theme with me today!) in the first act that makes me feel like the story is being explained to me and it's the kind of thing that's usually left to the third act, if it's even done at all. (Good movies don't need to lecture us as to what's happening, though, right?) Now, putting aside that this premise is ridiculous, it would have been so much more acceptable to me, I feel, if I hadn't known it was coming. &lt;br /&gt;But unfortunately, this is probably the most ridiculous Phillip K. Dick story I've encountered through film. It just doesn't hold any water. It creates so many open questions that it doesn't resolve and though I don't find myself praising &lt;i&gt;The Matrix&lt;/i&gt; too often these days, it definitely gets the manipulated real life thing a lot more right than this movie. And in part that's because this story rests on so many of our silly little fairy tale myths about soul mates and destiny and fate, things that I cannot take seriously and haven't been able to take seriously for years at this point.&lt;br /&gt;And then they try to explain how they manipulate and don't manipulate history. And it's the most hilariously selective history, mostly European and totally arbitrary. Doesn't pass the smell test.&lt;br /&gt;Just a dumb, sappy Hollywood movie. Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;4/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/5295584810566376885/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=5295584810566376885&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/5295584810566376885" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/5295584810566376885" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-adjustment-bureau-2011-george-nolfi.html" rel="alternate" title="The Adjustment Bureau (2011, George Nolfi)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-3503140019904966932</id><published>2015-06-07T11:21:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-07T11:21:28.308-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2006"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Drama"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Movies"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="War"></category><title type="text">Blood Diamond (2006, Edward Zwick)</title><content type="html">This is film feels like an attempt to cross an adventure movie with a war movie with a Hollywood message movie. At times it succeeds rather well but at other times it's borderline terrible.&lt;br /&gt;The film suffers from the typical Hollywood problem when making movies about Africa, which is that it has to be seen through the eyes of white people. At least this time the white person is from there, though. DiCaprio is excellent and remains and not that likable throughout the movie (when another film would have made him progressively more likable). Honsou is also great in what would have been the lead role had this movie not been made by Hollywood. (It probably is the lead role, but they still manage to make it feel as though it's not.) I feel Connelly is not exactly the right actor for her role, but I warmed up to her as the movie went on.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone is very committed, and that should make the movie succeed, right? The biggest hurdle is the often horrible expository dialogue that begins, not with any actual dialogue, but a map of the world telling us where Sierra Leone is. You know, because we're dumb. And then they cut in a meeting about the diamond trade with some of the opening scenes in order to tell us what's happening, rather than, you know, showing what's happening. And this continues throughout the film - though it is hardly constant - and is a source of constant annoyance. And a little bit of the DiCaprio-Connelly banter is also trying.&lt;br /&gt;The pacing is also problematic for what is, by modern standards, a long movie. But fortunately there's enough of story - contrived though it may be - that the odd pacing doesn't hurt the film like the expository dialogue. And the story is indeed contrived and over-told - the deal between a regular guy and a selfish, experienced person that eventually brings them together, paired with a big action climax where The Hero gets to confront The Villain (even though that isn't the climax itself). And after the big stupid action climax, there's a different big emotional climax, both of which feel inauthentic and more contrived than the rest of the already contrived story.&lt;br /&gt;And I guess that's why I have trouble enjoying the positive parts.&lt;br /&gt;5/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/3503140019904966932/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=3503140019904966932&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/3503140019904966932" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/3503140019904966932" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/blood-diamond-2006-edward-zwick.html" rel="alternate" title="Blood Diamond (2006, Edward Zwick)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-5347300946716919584</id><published>2015-06-06T18:17:00.002-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-06T18:17:41.054-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Murder Mystery"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Psychological Thriller"></category><title type="text">Gone Girl (2014, David Fincher)</title><content type="html">&lt;i&gt;This review contains some fairly serious SPOILERS&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before I get to talking about this excellent film, which I liked very much, I suppose I have to address the thing that must be addressed, namely the apparent misogyny.&lt;br /&gt;Had this movie been released 20 or even 10 years ago, I suspect nobody would have said anything. But in echo chamber of the internet, a movie like this is going to be misunderstood and no doubt roundly criticized for its portrayal of its central character. Let me just say right off the bat that I think accusations of misogyny miss the mark here. And here's where the spoilers come in!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The genre of the crazed woman destroying a man's wife has been around a really long time, film-wise, even though we might date it back only to &lt;i&gt;Fatal Attraction&lt;/i&gt; in terms of the sheer craziness of the lead female. (But if you watch classic film noir, you'll see that's not really true.) That's not to legitimize what is a rather misogynistic subgenre, but I do mean to point out that there is a rather long tradition of these types of movies, and they are usually not very clever.&lt;br /&gt;To even throw this film into those categories completely overlooks its effectiveness as a mystery and its effectiveness as a satire of the "missing blonde woman" obsessions of the 24-hour News Media. And, frankly, I find the film very good as both a mystery and a satire of media. It's far from Fincher's best, but it once again shows off his rather incredible ability to take what could be pretty weak material - given the multiple twists - and not only make it work as a mystery, but to add another dimension (or preserve it, if the media satire was in the novel, which we might assume it was).&lt;br /&gt;Very entertaining and well worth seeing.</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/5347300946716919584/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=5347300946716919584&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/5347300946716919584" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/5347300946716919584" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/gone-girl-2014-david-fincher.html" rel="alternate" title="Gone Girl (2014, David Fincher)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-7139259815923650825</id><published>2015-06-05T21:09:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-05T21:09:05.573-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2009"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Comic Book"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Fantasy"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Movies"></category><title type="text">Solomon Kane (2009, Michael J.

Like so many of these movies, there's virtually no character development (beyond the obvious arc for the hero), the plot is rather telegraphed and I strongly doubt the film has much to do with its source material. But the acting is extremely good for a bad movie, and the production values are shockingly high. I'm not sure Marc Antony from &lt;i&gt;Rome&lt;/i&gt; really works as a leading man, but whatever. So as these things go, it's certainly less terrible than most of them.

As a fan of the show, I really felt no need to read the books. But  when my friend told me he was really enjoying the audio books, I  thought I'd give it a listen. (Thanks Derek!)&lt;br /&gt;As  someone who avoids fantasy, I cannot say whether or not what Martin  does here is original, but it certainly strikes me as rather radical for  a genre that normally seeks to make its readers happy.&lt;br /&gt;The  first thing Martin does right is that he populates his stories with  "real" people - by this I mean that the people are morally ambiguous:  they do good and bad things, they have good and bad motives, they make  mistakes, etc. So often in the genre, we have a hero who is Good (with a  supposedly fatal flaw that never quite proves fatal), we have villains  who are Pure Evil. We might have someone who puts on an act, but at  bottom everyone is either Good or Evil. Not so in Martin's world. &lt;br /&gt;The second thing he does well is world creation. The world of &lt;em&gt;A Song of Ice and Fire&lt;/em&gt; is so dense that it rivals the universes of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; for depth. There is so much backstory - for literally everyone, and the  world at large - that it's easy to lose yourself in the massive world  he has created. You can investigate so many angles (especially with the  different wikis) that you can literally believe this is history, and  that makes it a lot harder to criticize other aspect's of Martin's  prose, just because he has built this giant universe, an overwhelming  one.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the way Martin introduces his  characters is unparalleled in my experience of the genre (with, perhaps  the exception of one character in the &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt; series). And here we get to the SPOILERS!!!&lt;br /&gt;SPOILER ALERT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br data-mce-bogus="1" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven't read the books or seen the show, I'm about to reveal some major plot points.&lt;br /&gt;Think  about how Martin introduces Tyrion, arguably the hero of the entire  story. Tyrion is not only unhero like in his build and his behaviour,  but he's actually positioned by Martin to possibly be a villain until  about 2/3rds of the way through this first book. That's fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Also,  Ned is positioned as The Hero for the vast majority of the book. (This  is what won me over in the show. I so thought Ned was going to live.)  And instead his heroism, or rather his character traits we normally  associate with heroism, lead him to his death. He is, rather than a  hero, a fool.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, there is  Littlefinger. Sure, he seems conniving. But he also seems minor and  rather harmless compared to the Lannisters. This is how Martin  introduces perhaps &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; Villain. (The villain controlling the villains, without their knowledge.) &lt;br /&gt;But,  though all of these things are impressive, there are still some obvious  flaws to his work that keeps this book (at least) from being  transcendent.&lt;br /&gt;The first is Martin's  obsession with description, which goes part and parcel with his world  creation. There are a few moments in this very, very long novel where  you're just like "Jesus Tapdancing Christ, stop listing things."  Particurlarly when Sansa is at the tournament or when Bran is learning  about history. It's just too much. And I feel like though it provides  more of the history, couldn't this have been done more effectively?&lt;br /&gt;And  of course the dialogue is merely fine. It's not quotable (for me  anyway), it's not life changing. It serves it's purpose, but it's hardly  great dialogue to go with classics outside of fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;But  overall this is very impressive and it has changed how I view a genre I  thought I hated. I'm glad I was able to enjoy it even while being  caught up with the show.&lt;br /&gt;8/10 </content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/7406859524419525775/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=7406859524419525775&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/7406859524419525775" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/7406859524419525775" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/a-game-of-thrones-1996-by-george-rr.html" rel="alternate" title="A Game of Thrones (1996) by George RR Martin" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-1790821083206261784</id><published>2015-06-02T17:00:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-06-02T17:00:00.528-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2011"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Books"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Non Fiction"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Self Help"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Writing"></category><title type="text">Do the Work (2011) by Steven Pressfield</title><content type="html">If you struggle with completing things on time, or completing things  at all, this is a book for you. (When I say things, I mean creative  endeavours.) However, you really only need to read &lt;em&gt;The War of Art&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;  This book is helpful to me, but it's also a crock. It's 100 pages in  the hardcover form, but that's only because of the formatting. It's  probably somewhere between 50-66 pages if we're being charitable. If  not, it's even less. Sure, some of that formatting is to an artistic  purpose - to emphasize the words - but it's also to diguise that this  isn't anything more than an article hiding as a book. Frankly it should  be available for free online, perhaps as a way of convincing you to buy &lt;em&gt;The War of Art&lt;/em&gt; (which you should read and probably buy if you are a struggling writer). &lt;br /&gt;I  would highly recommend getting this from the library if you do indeed  want to read more of Pressfield's very astute assessment of how to  write. But don't buy it.&lt;br /&gt;6/10 </content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/1790821083206261784/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=1790821083206261784&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/1790821083206261784" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/1790821083206261784" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/06/do-work-2011-by-steven-pressfield.html" rel="alternate" title="Do the Work (2011) by Steven Pressfield" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-8825993093096143274</id><published>2015-05-28T20:43:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-28T20:43:13.228-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2013"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Drama"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Movies"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Romance"></category><title type="text">Adore (2013, Anne Fontaine)</title><content type="html">This film is a really mixed bag.

As usual everything sounds great (though in one case the sound quality is weak compared to the other tracks) and professional. The tracks are from all over the place, as usual, and it's a record that's for Hendrix fans rather than for casual listeners. There are a few new songs, but many have other takes other places. One notable thing is that this version of "Sunshine of Your Love" contains a hilarious bass solo from Redding, much like some live versions of this song.

Otherwise it's not anything special, some hilarious dialogue before nad in it. &lt;br /&gt;Just like any show (it seems) Hendrix's amps keep breaking.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the hilghlight of the entire disc is their take on Dylan's "Like a Rolling Stone." Hendrix was always a great interpretive artists, particularly of Dylan. Though it lacks the bite in the original, it more than makes up for it in the alternative arrangement, that allows Hendrix to show off. It's the second best arrangement of the song I've ever heard, I think. Second only to the original. And a close second at that. (I.e. I prefer it to the &lt;i&gt;Before the Flood&lt;/i&gt; version, for example.)&lt;br /&gt;The version of "Hey Joe" is a little different than the one on &lt;i&gt;Miami Pop&lt;/i&gt; and again seems to demonstrate Hendrix getting restless playing one of his "signature" songs.&lt;br /&gt;This disc includes yet another version of "Hear My Train a Comin'." It's always a good performance from Hendrix - especially live - but here it actually sounds briefly like it's about to turn into "Voodoo Child" at times, which is hilarious, given the inclusion of that track later in this disc. This one's even more jammier than usual, if that's possible.&lt;br /&gt;Then they cover "Sunshine of Your Love" as an instrumental, a thing they were doing a lot (it's on the &lt;i&gt;BBC Sessions&lt;/i&gt; and on one of the studio rarities collections at the very least). It's a good version as these things go. But there's kind of a hilarious "bass solo" by Redding which just reminds us all how it was such a shame that Hendrix was burdened with this guy so long. First they force Hendrix to include his songs on his albums, then someone persuades him to let him "solo" during a jam. Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;The version of "Little Wing" is the most straight ahead, straight up of these "highlights", so it's the least interesting.&lt;br /&gt;The version of "Are You Experienced?" is a surprise not just because it was a bit of a "deep cut" by this point but because it's so ragged (and feedback-drenched).&lt;br /&gt;That's followed by a more straightforward rendition of "Manic Depression," though Hendrix's solo is longer than in the studio version.&lt;br /&gt;"Voodoo Child" (the famous one, not the &lt;i&gt;Ladyland&lt;/i&gt; jam) is next. It's a decent version.&lt;br /&gt;This disc concludes with "Purple Haze." There's a nifty solo in the middle.&lt;br /&gt;I would say that if these are the highlights, maybe I don't need to listen to the box set (though I'm tempted) but a the longer songs ("Like a Rolling Stone" in particular) are so good that it makes up for the somewhat rote interpretations of some of their hits. Good stuff and I am intrigued by the box set.&lt;br /&gt;8/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/8098853347255640045/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=8098853347255640045&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/8098853347255640045" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/8098853347255640045" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/05/winterland-highlights-2011-by-jimi.html" rel="alternate" title="Winterland [Highlights] (2011) by the Jimi Hendrix Experience" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-1048106328793294550</id><published>2015-05-27T17:00:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-27T17:00:04.167-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1968"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2013"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Blues Rock"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Live Music"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Music"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Psychedelic Rock"></category><title type="text">Miami Pop Festival (2013) by the Jimi Hendrix Experience</title><content type="html">This is an Experiene concert from the 1968 Miami Pop Festival (obviously) containing remarkably little music from either &lt;i&gt;Axis &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;Ladyland&lt;/i&gt; (which they had already begun recording). Actually I don't think there's a single song. It's a strong set and it shows off the Experience as a great live band, which is something we don't always think of them as (or at least I don't).&lt;br /&gt;The opening version of "Hey Joe" is considerably looser than any I've heard before, opening with more than a minute of feedback and definitely showing signs that the band is getting tired of playing this song.&lt;br /&gt;The version of "Foxey Lady" is a little more aggressive than the studio version and features more noodling by Hendrix than usual.&lt;br /&gt;Then they cover a song called "Tax Free," which I've never heard of, which is a rather mamoth jam featuring excellent (and feedback-drenched) paying from Hendrix. There's even a rare Mitchell drum solo.&lt;br /&gt;Then there's a completely forgetable version of "Fire."&lt;br /&gt;And that's followed by what seems to have been one of Hendrix's favourite songs, "Hear My Train a Comin'." (Listen to a Hendrix rarity compilation and there's a good chance it's on it. Jesus he played it a lot.) And this is not the last time you'll hear Hendrix blow an amp. Apparently it happened a lot.&lt;br /&gt;This is followed by a seemingly rather rote rendition of "I Don't Live Today" that goes into full blown feedback at around the 4:30 mark and then they double the pace for his solo!&lt;br /&gt;What you might call the centrepiece (or the climax) of the set is a 12 minute version of "Red House," which should remove any doubt in the mind that Hendrix was only an okay blues guitarist or just an average lead guitarist.&lt;br /&gt;A ragged performance of "Purple Haze" concludes the set and, again, Hendrix's frustration at having to play the same damn songs over and over again is evident in his little detours off script.&lt;br /&gt;The rest of the disc is fleshed out by two tracks they did for an afternoon show for the same festival. They're nothing special.&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, this is a great performance from Hendrix and the Experience. It shows off a very different side of theirs from the studio albums or, say, &lt;i&gt;The BBC Sessions&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;It's worth listening to if you have any interest in Hendrix or if all you've ever heard of him live is &lt;i&gt;Band of Gypsies&lt;/i&gt;, a very different record.&lt;br /&gt;8/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/1048106328793294550/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=1048106328793294550&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/1048106328793294550" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/1048106328793294550" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/05/miami-pop-festival-2013-by-jimi-hendrix.html" rel="alternate" title="Miami Pop Festival (2013) by the Jimi Hendrix Experience" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-2187128417737379093</id><published>2015-05-26T18:09:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-26T18:09:17.717-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1780s"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2012"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Classical"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Music"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="String Quartet"></category><title type="text">String Quartets Op. 33 'Russian' (2012) by the London Haydn Quartet</title><content type="html">Though these quartets were written after the great "Sun" quartets (perhaps because they were written after) I like them a lot better initially. They sound a lot more like my idea of what a High Classical quartet should sound like. Though their forebears were undoutedbly the more innovative and revolutionary set, these are the more appealing, perhaps because they don't sound so old. Perhaps with these, more than any other set, you can hear why he is the Father of the String Quartet. The individual instruments are all distinguishable, they all their important parts to play and, of course, they are incredibly tuneful. And Haydn incorporates his sense of humour into more than one of them, something that sets him apart from other composers (to my ears).

I hate remakes / reboots in principle (unless they are done effectively, which is relatively rare) and frankly, my favourite of the trilogy is the first one, whereas it seems like everyone else's favourite is the sequel. This movie takes its cue from the sequel, as is obvious from the ads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;But I also appreciate having a visceral response to films and, once I read the reviews, I couldn't ignore it any more. (Also, my brother loved it.)&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the film is being championed as some kind of return to traditional effects, and while that's true, I for one read &lt;i&gt;way&lt;/i&gt; too much about it ahead of time and was disppointed by the ton of CGI. So just know that though there are an absolute ton of stunts and real effects, there is also a lot of CGI, especially in the early goings. (You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.) But that's nitpicky, especially since the CGI is used to a purpose here, to augment the stunts, rather than to replace them.&lt;br /&gt;So, the movie. It's ridiculous. It bares some resemblance to a reverse (storywise) version of &lt;i&gt;Mad Max 2&lt;/i&gt;. The story remains ridiculous and unimportant. The costumes and cars are more over-the-top than ever and the dialogue and character names remain iffy/campy (though I feel like there was a lot more time spent on backstory of some of the villains than in other films in the series). But the film basically never stops. My brain was in nitpicky mode through the opening and the first part of the first chase, but by what you might call part two of the first chase, my brain was overwhelmed with nonstop campy action and the fact that this movie is essentially two very well-done car chase sequences stitched together with a vague allegory of the oppressed overcoming their oppressors. (FEMINIST PROPGANDA ALERT!!!)&lt;br /&gt;The film is enjoyable and, refreshingly, doesn't it take itself seriously, but in a way that resonnates with us more so than other films that are campy. What I mean to say is: the characters take this movie utterly seriously, but the film around them does not. (There's one particular sequence that sticks in my mind where one character is utterly convinced of his success at his endeavour, and the music - which is pretty obvious - tells us he is about to accomplish something and then he utterly fails.) Too many films these days have their own characters aware of the film they are in as if that's the only standard for not talking yourself seriously. And it was nice to see a goofy action film where the characters weren't in on it.&lt;br /&gt;I thoroughly enjoyed myself, once my brain was battered into submission. And I would highly recommend seeing it if you are a fan of the original series, if you are a fan of non-stop action, or if you like a good car chase.&lt;br /&gt;8/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/5384948818199695378/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=5384948818199695378&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/5384948818199695378" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/5384948818199695378" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/05/mad-max-fury-road-2015-george-miller.html" rel="alternate" title="Mad Max: Fury Road (2015, George Miller)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-7342323407676022460</id><published>2015-05-20T20:08:00.002-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-21T09:08:59.289-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Black comedy"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Dark Comedy"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Dramedy"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="TV"></category><title type="text">Fargo - Season 1 (2014)</title><content type="html">&lt;i&gt;I normally review a TV series after I've watched all the seasons. However, given that the second season of &lt;/i&gt;Fargo&lt;i&gt; will consist of an entirely new cast and plot, I am reviewing them separately. Needless to say, SPOILERS!!!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;I was really, really skeptical of this idea, not only because I was once a gigantic Coen brothers fan and &lt;i&gt;Fargo&lt;/i&gt; remains among their very best films. Making a film into a show is a dangerous proposition. Making a film into a show nearly two decades after that film was released seems insane, to put it mildly. Doomed to failure. When I heard the positive reviews, I wondered what the critics were smoking. (This wouldn't be the first time the critics were wrong about a TV show.)&lt;br /&gt;But they were right. It's an incredible thing, but this show has the tone and aura of the movie down in a way I couldn't have possibly imagined. Remember &lt;i&gt;M*A*S*H&lt;/i&gt;? The show had to go a completely different direction from the film in order to become a success. (Well a commercial one, anyway.) But this show conjures up the film without feeling like they are repeating anything. It helps that the plots are just barely linked.&lt;br /&gt;The show goes off the rails a bit near the end, in part because it gets ridiculously, cartoonishly violent. But, less we forget. This is sort of a comedy, albeit a very, very, very dark one. So I guess that's excusable.&lt;br /&gt;The cast is fantastic, the characters are all memorable, the laughs never really stop and if the ending is little odd (not to mention, shot in a totally incorrect part of the world) given how the show started, we don't care that much, just because everything else about this is so damn good.&lt;br /&gt;8/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/7342323407676022460/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=7342323407676022460&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/7342323407676022460" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/7342323407676022460" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/05/fargo-season-1-2014.html" rel="alternate" title="Fargo - Season 1 (2014)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-4049088967056031497</id><published>2015-05-19T19:02:00.003-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-20T09:36:06.244-04:00</updated><title type="text">Sol Invictus (2015) by Faith No More</title><content type="html">When I was young I hated reunions, I felt like they were cash-grabs, things only sell-outs would do. I had a hard time thinking of musicians, particularly my musical idols, as people. I had a an idea of artistic integrity and I thought that musicians should stick to it (or face my wrath, I guess). But another reason I hated reunions was because I was a fan of (mostly) "classic" rock. And the vast majority of those bands which reunited...well, those reunions went badly. And my favourite band at the time had never reunited. And the band that took over that role form them only reunited for one off concerts every few years. Both "preserved" their legacies.&lt;br /&gt;It's a lot more culturally acceptable to reunite now - hell it's practically mandatory. There have been a lot of reunions that have been judged to be "artistically" successful (in addition to being commercially successful which, you have to assume, was the reason for the reunion) in a way that most "classic" rock reunions were not. (I can think of a few successful classic rock reunions, but they were always after brief periods, not decades.) It must be hard for bands to have broken up to not jump on this bandwagon, provided they can stand the site of each other. Nostalgia is one of the great trucks of the internet.&lt;br /&gt;But I don't know how a reunion can be culturally relevant. Especially if it's been decades. If it's been a few years, then sure, why not. I can think of more than a few bands that broke up or took a "hiatus" for a few years, only to come back with some of their best work. (Soft Machine, Traffic, King Crimson to name but a few.) But decades is different.&lt;br /&gt;And cultural relevance is the objective isn't it? At least, I think it is. It is for me, as a judging listener, a listener who cannot turn off his brain. In fact, for me, it's been cultural transcendence, something that is extremely hard to determine when someone is sitting in the middle of the culture the music is supposedly transcending.&lt;br /&gt;But the older I get, the more I wonder if cultural transcendence really is that important. Sure, it's important for the historian in me, but is it important for the listener?&lt;br /&gt;I don't think it's important for the members of the bands that reunite. Sure, some of them just want to make money. But many of them are probably trying to have fun, trying to recapture the joy they had earlier in their lives. That's a very human desire.&lt;br /&gt;And so, as I age, I am finding it harder and hard to spit on all reunions, especially now that bands that I like, and who I never got to see, are reuniting and putting out competent product. What's wrong with something being good, even if it's not transcendent, or even relevant?&lt;br /&gt;And this record is good. It's not great, but it's good. It's way better than I thought it would be. It reminds me way too much of Tomahawk's "reunion" record (I can't help but think of it, sirrt) though it's less interesting.&lt;br /&gt;But the thing that it does well, which I guess the previous two albums didn't do as well - though I love &lt;i&gt;King for a Day &lt;/i&gt;- is that it combines their tendencies into the individual songs, like on &lt;i&gt;Angel Dust&lt;/i&gt;, rather than as separate genre pieces. This band does not sound schizophrenic (relatively speaking!) compared to the band that released &lt;i&gt;King for a Day&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Album of the Year&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;My worst fears are not confirmed. I actually want to keep listening to this.&lt;br /&gt;7/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/4049088967056031497/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=4049088967056031497&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/4049088967056031497" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/4049088967056031497" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/05/sol-invictus-2015-by-faith-no-more.html" rel="alternate" title="Sol Invictus (2015) by Faith No More" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-2200332060807179766</id><published>2015-05-19T18:04:00.002-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-19T18:04:53.684-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1968"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1969"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1970"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2013"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Blues Rock"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Funk Rock"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Music"></category><title type="text">People, Hell and Angels (2013) by Jimi Hendrix</title><content type="html">This is apparently the "final" official rarities collection we will get from the Hendrix vaults. These are the last previously unreleased studio tracks. It only took 40 years.&lt;br /&gt;This collection shows off the direction Hendrix was contemplating post-Electric Ladyland, the funkier, rootsier one displayed on &lt;i&gt;First Rays of the New Rising Sun&lt;/i&gt;, his unfinished final album. But these performances are looser than that record, and they have fewer overdubs. It's fairly obvious that most of them are just (complete) early demos. But the music is fantastic - Hendrix is on fire, even if he's playing more lead (and more conventional rhythm) than he used to and even if the music is mostly less risky than at his peak. (Also, Billy Cox is so much better than Noel Redding.)&lt;br /&gt;It's notable that some of the performances are pretty unconventional for him: at least two feature different lead singers, at least two also feature a saxophone, a real rarity for him, and I think there's an organ on one of them.&lt;br /&gt;This is absolutely an album for Hendrix fans. It's probably a terrible introduction to the man: though his playing is awesome, as usual, it is not his best set of songs by a long-shot - the lyrics are particularly weak, relatively speaking - and it would convince you that all he did was play blues rock. But if you love Hendrix already, you should check it out as even Hendrix's demos are worth listening to.&lt;br /&gt;6/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/2200332060807179766/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=2200332060807179766&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/2200332060807179766" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/2200332060807179766" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/05/people-hell-and-angels-2013-by-jimi.html" rel="alternate" title="People, Hell and Angels (2013) by Jimi Hendrix" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-6691991438028661893</id><published>2015-05-19T17:00:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-19T17:00:02.625-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1992"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Bop"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Cool Jazz"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Jazz"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Music"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Post Bop"></category><title type="text">Lush Life: The Music of Billy Strayhorn (1992) by Joe Henderson</title><content type="html">People are weird. Apparently Henderson toiled in relative obscurity for decades and then one day, in the early '90s, people lost their shit over him, though stylistically he is, you could argue, a pre-Trane player, or a least one who never followed Trane through the door when Trane finished removing the frames around it.&lt;br /&gt;So, the good: Here are some imaginative covers of Strayhorn's work, many of which rethink the originals in new and exciting ways. The band clearly reinterpret the music; they are not content, like so many others, to replicate the tracks and just change up the solos. So that's what makes this worth checking out.&lt;br /&gt;The bad: This is still just Bop/Post Bop. Henderson gets a little skronky on a few numbers, but even then his playing is very restrained compared to most (good) young saxophonists. No wonder so many people liked this when it came out. It's a nostalgia trip. It would have been downright notable in 1965 or so. But in 1992? I can't really see the acclaim. It's a very good "covers" album in a style that has been passe for 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;7/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/6691991438028661893/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=6691991438028661893&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/6691991438028661893" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/6691991438028661893" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/05/lush-life-music-of-billy-strayhorn-1992.html" rel="alternate" title="Lush Life: The Music of Billy Strayhorn (1992) by Joe Henderson" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-7886942972681658278</id><published>2015-05-18T14:19:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-18T14:19:53.265-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2010"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="30 for 30"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Football"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Justice"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Law"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="NCAA"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Texas"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="TV"></category><title type="text">30 for 30: Pony Excess (2010, Thaddeus D. Matula)</title><content type="html">It's tough to talk about the content of a film like this without talking about the concept of "student athlete" and how the NCAA (and others) have essentially brainwashed the media and most of the United States into believing that it is immoral for "student athletes" to be compensated for the performances that drive the insane amount of money that the NCAA and these universities (many of them - most of them? - private) make. But let's try to put that aside.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of whether or not you think the NCAA is a horribly corrupt, exploitative institution, they do create rules, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. And, unfortunately, if you agree to play by certain rules, you have an imperative to follow those rules (in most cases). This is a &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; in-depth film about the flouting of the rules that allowed Southern Methodist University - a very small school, relatively speaking - to become the best amateur program in the United States. Some effort is made to put this into context: "everyone else" was doing it, and a media war meant SMU was the target rather than another school. All that's interesting.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, as someone else has pointed out, this film is too long for the subject matter - or at least it's too long for the way that subject matter is presented. And I think it's the presentation that's the real problem, and it doesn't surprise me that this man has never made another feature. This movie is overly edited - at times there are a number of crazy jump cuts per minute and the cuts never really stop - and it's odd that a style befitting an action film was adopted for a story about "corruption" at a University. The relentless cutting and the length of the film make it hard to take, no matter how interested I was, and the tale as one of morality, rather than an investigation into the deeper reasons as to why, make it less interesting as well. Also, any film that relies this much on Skip Bayless for its credibility has problems.&lt;br /&gt;5/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/7886942972681658278/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=7886942972681658278&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/7886942972681658278" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/7886942972681658278" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/05/30-for-30-pony-excess-2010-thaddeus-d.html" rel="alternate" title="30 for 30: Pony Excess (2010, Thaddeus D.

Marian Jones took performance enhancing drugs. To hear her tell it, she may have not been 100% aware that's what they were when she took them. (Remember, it was the very early 2000s.) But Singleton doesn't do a very good job of making her case. He inserts himself into the film and more seems to want to tell the story of how Marian Jones impacted her fans.&lt;br /&gt;Jones got an absolutely absurd penalty: she went to jail for 6 months for lying to the government and spent 48 days - 48 days!!!!!!!! - in solitary confinement and there is no doubt in my mind she got the sentence because a) she's black and b) she's famous. Yes, she should have been more honest in her initial with the interview, and yes, she shouldn't have taken them in the first place, but both of those moral imperatives ignore the social circumstances that surrounded her use of performance enhancing drugs and her denial of such use. Namely: the pressure to win, the willingness to do &lt;i&gt;anything &lt;/i&gt;her coaches said, the fact that all people lie, and that many even lie to authorities, and of course her blackness in the United States, in a country which continues to treat black people horribly. Singleton does a pretty piss poor job of dealing with all of this ambiguity.&lt;br /&gt;Instead he tells us she's a new mom and her husband tells us that she's dedicating her life to church and family like a good little girl.&lt;br /&gt;A missed opportunity, like I said.&lt;br /&gt;5/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/1217320935551806203/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=1217320935551806203&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/1217320935551806203" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/1217320935551806203" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/05/30-for-30-marion-jones-press-pause-2010.html" rel="alternate" title="30 for 30: Marion Jones: Press Pause (2010, John Singleton)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-4587503711680902436</id><published>2015-05-17T20:08:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-17T20:08:09.328-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="30 for 30"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Baseball"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Documentary"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Dodgers"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Latinos"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Mexican Americans"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sports"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="TV"></category><title type="text">30 for 30: Fernando Nation (Cruz Angeles)</title><content type="html">This is a somewhat awkwardly structured and edited film that still manages to do one of the major things I want from a sports documentary: it makes me wish I was there. I lived through Linsanity, but obviously not in New York. Fernandomania was Linsanity well before Linsanity (and with a better player), with so much more meaning given the terrible events that led to the building of Dodger Stadium. I would have a preferred a film that explored the social aspects a little more than this did - frankly I think a feature-length would have easily been possible with the subject matter here - but on the whole this is a great story, and the awkward telling of it is easily forgiven since the second half of it really made me wish I had been alive during his arrival.&lt;br /&gt;7/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/4587503711680902436/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=4587503711680902436&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/4587503711680902436" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/4587503711680902436" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/05/30-for-30-fernando-nation-cruz-angeles.html" rel="alternate" title="30 for 30: Fernando Nation (Cruz Angeles)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-5671722978772197057</id><published>2015-05-15T19:36:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-15T19:36:21.185-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2010"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="30 for 30"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Basketball"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Civil War"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Documentary"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="NBA"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="TV"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="War"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Yugoslavia"></category><title type="text">30 for 30: Once Brothers (2010, Michael Tolajian)</title><content type="html">This is a compelling, moving portrait of what it was like to be from an upstart country in a sport, shocking the world, and what it was like to be an early European player in the NBA, and what it's like to have your country torn apart by civil war. It's also a compelling portrait of the loss of a young athlete. Unfortunately, the narrator is also the lead interviewee, which not only makes the film awkward - from a technical standpoint, how does a narrator introduce himself? - but leads to easy accusations of bias. I have no idea if it's biased or not, as I didn't care about basketball until years later, and I am no expert on the Yugoslavian wars. But, regardless, it's a poor choice to have Divac both narrate and be an interview.

Apparently he was also extremely innovative: in the early '80s he pioneered this style of heavily percussive playing. (There is some controversy over whether he was the first person to play like this, or whether he was he first one to play like this on a &lt;i&gt;steel string&lt;/i&gt; acoustic guitar. The latter is likely the more accurate version.) And of course it is a tragedy when anyone, especially a talented musician like this, dies young.&lt;br /&gt;But, like so many extraordinarily talented guitar players, Michael Hedges often has terrible taste. I am thinking of someone like Yngwie Malmsteen, a man who woudn't know restraint if it refused to slap him in the face. Or someone like Eric Johnson, who uses his prodigious abilities to make terrible soft rock. Or someone like John Pizzarelli, who wishes the last five decades had never come to pass. To be (un?)fair to Hedges, he's more like Johnson or Pizzarrelli, than Malmsteen.&lt;br /&gt;When Hedges is playing by himself, he is fantastic. But he just can't seem to help himself: he has to add all these effects and additional instruments that horribly date this recording to the '90s. Sometimes the fretless bass comes off as horribly cliche, but sometimes it works. That's not the problem. The problem is Hedges' own contributions: brutal synthesizer parts that end any internal debate I was having about whether or not this was truly "new age" music and, perhaps worse, flutes!!! If only the &lt;i&gt;South Park&lt;/i&gt; episode "Pandemic" had existed when Hedges was still alive. And the effects he uses on his playing also date the recording rather horribly.&lt;br /&gt;But he's still an awesome player and the unadorned tracks (as well as a few with just the bass) work very well and have convinced me not only of his talent, but of my need to hear what he was doing in the early '80s. But man, get someone else to produce your records.&lt;br /&gt;6/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/953144202127156846/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=953144202127156846&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/953144202127156846" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/953144202127156846" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/05/oracle-1996-by-michael-hedges.html" rel="alternate" title="Oracle (1996) by Michael Hedges" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-3584590646966542115</id><published>2015-05-14T21:12:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-15T08:54:01.302-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2010"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2011"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2012"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2013"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Bootlegging"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Crime"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Period"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Prohibition"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="TV"></category><title type="text">Boardwalk Empire (2010)</title><content type="html">&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;SPOILERS!!!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had &lt;i&gt;Boardwalk Empire&lt;/i&gt; premiered in 2000 instead of 2010 - hell, had it premiered in 2005 instead of 2010 - I think we'd think about it very differently. (Or, at the very least, I would.) It's a show full of great actors, with great costumes and sets and a fantastic sense of place. If the CGI is sometimes a little weak, it would have been totally acceptable in the early century.&lt;br /&gt;I think we would have forgiven the complete lack of depth in the writing because everything else about the show is so good. We would have been okay with the massive deviations from history too.&lt;br /&gt;But this show didn't premiere in 2000 or 20005. It premiered in 2010 - over a decade after &lt;a href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.ca/2014/12/the-sopranos-1999.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; began to irrevocably alter the television landscape in terms of production values and "realism" and long after both &lt;i&gt;Deadwood&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Wire&lt;/i&gt; set up the idea that dramatic TV shows could, nay should, function as allegories for bigger issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Boardwalk Empire&lt;/i&gt; heeded the lessons of &lt;i&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/i&gt; but not of &lt;i&gt;Deadwood&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Wire&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mad Men&lt;/i&gt; and even &lt;i&gt;Breaking Bad&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; And I guess that's why I would have forgiven it a lot in 2000 or 2005.&lt;br /&gt;I haven't seen the first three seasons in quite some time, so it's hard for me to pinpoint exact moments that disappointed me (with one exception, which I will get to in a moment). I just remember constantly waiting for it to get better. Constantly hoping that the show would be about something more than just bootleggers during the Prohibition Era. And I kept up with it until the end of third season, &lt;a href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.ca/2013/03/did-boardwalk-empire-jump-shark-at-end.html" target="_blank"&gt;when I worried that maybe it Jumped the Shark&lt;/a&gt;, at least in the mildest of terms. And so I quit the show for a while.&lt;br /&gt;People told me to come back to it and I did. The fourth season felt rather repetitive only this time it was White who had the foil, not Thompson. Other things continued on as usual; too much as usual. It's like we were reliving everything. It also felt like they were trying to stunt cast their way out of a lack of new things to say: Patricia Arquette, Jeffrey Wright, that guy from &lt;i&gt;The Killing&lt;/i&gt;. And though the fifth season feels like Thompson (and others) have undergone some major character development (though they don't appear to have aged much) and the story seems to finally be significantly different than "Thompson fends off another competitor to the Atlantic City Syndicate" version 5 (at least until they kill off Patricia Arquette's character and everything goes back to normal), but they don't appear to have come up with &lt;i&gt;enough&lt;/i&gt; of a story, as we get flashbacks to Nucky's childhood constantly and the only reasons I can think of are either because they do not have enough ideas for this plot, or from some kind of misplaced sense of narrative completeness (which is what happens with the dumb finale).&lt;br /&gt;It says something that my favourite moment of this entire show was "Mueller" saying "I for one refuse to be ruled by fear" and then running to heed his wife. It says something else that when Chalky died I didn't give a shit. I mean, I knew I was supposed, but I just didn't. And it really doesn't feel like the right guys come after Nucky. I mean, other people hated him more, right? It really doesn't make sense. And, finally, the wrapping up, the tying up, whatever you want to call it, feels really laborious. Especially the scene with Gillian.&lt;br /&gt;After two seasons I was going to give it a 7, but can't even bring myself to do that.&lt;br /&gt;6/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/3584590646966542115/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=3584590646966542115&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/3584590646966542115" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/3584590646966542115" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/05/boardwalk-empire-2010.html" rel="alternate" title="Boardwalk Empire (2010)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-436816370172667452</id><published>2015-05-13T17:30:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-13T17:30:02.140-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1970"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Live Music"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Mod"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Music"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Power Pop"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Rock"></category><title type="text">Live at Leeds (1970) by the Who</title><content type="html">Is this the greatest live album of all time?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never used to care about live albums. I never used to care about &lt;i&gt;live music&lt;/i&gt;. Music used to live in my bedroom and I had no idea that there was some other side to it. Frankly I didn't understand why people went to concerts. The idea that a band could be &lt;i&gt;better&lt;/i&gt; on stage than in the studio seemed totally insane to me. Totally unfathomable.&lt;br /&gt;I was forced to confront that idea when I went away to university and seeing (not very famous) bands became a standard thing: a couple times per month or more I would see bands, usually with no intent to see a band, it's just what happened at the bar I frequented. And I encountered a Canadian musician named Chris Colepaugh, who frequented our town because of our partying nature (I guess) and who became something of a favourite of everyone's. And he played showy classic rock which was right up my alley when I was 19 and 20. And so I bought one of his albums.&lt;br /&gt;And though at first I didn't hate it, as I got older and my tastes changed I began to dislike it rather intensely. Perhaps more than I should. And I guess I realized (slowly) that bands could be better live than in the studio.&lt;br /&gt;So after the last decade+ I have managed to see some reasonably famous bands as well as to collect more than a few live albums (unfortunately mostly by just a couple bands). I'd like to think I have a much better idea of what makes a good live album now than I did 15 years ago, as I've now seen a fair number of shows and listened to a fair number of live albums.&lt;br /&gt;But I still have a problem with &lt;i&gt;Live at Leeds&lt;/i&gt; and that is that I've only ever known the 1995 expanded edition. For years that seemed to me like it could be called "The Greatest Live Album of All Time." Why? Everything's better than in the studio: "Heaven and Hell" no longer sucks, "Tattoo" is better, "Young Man Blues" is definitive as is "Summertime Blues", this version of "A Quick One" is one of the highlights of their entire catalogue, there's really not much &lt;i&gt;Tommy&lt;/i&gt; (which is a good thing) and "Magic Bus" is so much better than the studio it kind of melts my brain. The hits are also at least louder here than in the studio. Also, funny banter.&lt;br /&gt;But only six of these songs were on the original and I can't even imagine the record with just six songs. It's six of the best, but it omits my favourite or second favourite and their excellent cover of "Fortune Teller" among other things. Turns out, during the actual show they played &lt;i&gt;33 songs&lt;/i&gt; (much of them &lt;i&gt;Tommy&lt;/i&gt; filler) and that wasn't available until &lt;i&gt;2001&lt;/i&gt;, 30 years later. So unless you went to the show, you really had no idea what the concert was like. The album people have constantly championed as "The Greatest" had only six of these songs and &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; banter. What was wrong with people?&lt;br /&gt;Well, at least 5 of the six tracks on the original are indeed awesome. But I don't think that's it. Think about the context:&lt;br /&gt;People were not used to listen to loud rock music on record in 1970. Sabbath was just getting started. Zeppelin had only released two albums. Purple wasn't a metal band yet. Only a few other bands qualified as &lt;i&gt;as loud &lt;/i&gt;as those. Certainly the Who were not one of them, unless you had the opportunity to see them live, or you watched &lt;i&gt;Monterey Pop&lt;/i&gt;. What were the live rock albums at this time? Half of &lt;i&gt;Wheels of Fire&lt;/i&gt;; &lt;i&gt;Live/Dead;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Get Yer Ya Yas Out&lt;/i&gt;. What else? Not much. Of those, only Cream's was loud and it wasn't curated very well. (I for one &lt;i&gt;just love&lt;/i&gt; 13 minute drum solos...)&lt;br /&gt;Before &lt;i&gt;Live at Leeds&lt;/i&gt; came out, you know what people thought was the Greatest Live Album of All Time? &lt;i&gt;Live at the Apollo&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Live at the Star Hamburg Club&lt;/i&gt;. That was the competition. It's pretty easy to beat that competition when you have distortion and power chords.&lt;br /&gt;I don't think this is the Greatest Live Album of All Time in part because I think that's kind of a stupid question and in part because it's based on a rather old assessment of live albums, when the Dead had only released &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt;, for example. There are now literally hundreds of thousands of (rock) live albums. How can anyone figure it out?&lt;br /&gt;But what it is is a portrait of a great live band at the peak of their powers. &lt;i&gt;Every&lt;/i&gt; song on this is better than its studio version ("Fortune Teller" excepted as I don't think they did that one in the studio). And that's all we should ever want of a live album (or a concert for that matter).&lt;br /&gt;10/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/436816370172667452/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=436816370172667452&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/436816370172667452" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/436816370172667452" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/05/live-at-leeds-1970-by-who.html" rel="alternate" title="Live at Leeds (1970) by the Who" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-4689829803769216658</id><published>2015-05-13T17:00:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-13T17:00:06.074-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1970"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Music"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Prog Rock"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Progressive Rock"></category><title type="text">In the Wake of Poseidon (1970) by King Crimson</title><content type="html">Full disclosure: King crimsion is one of the bands that "changed my life" on a musical level and they remain among my favourites. I have trouble being objective about them. I'm trying, but it's probably not possible.&lt;br /&gt;We should remember that this album was made by a band that wasn't really a band at all: Michael Giles and Lake were essentially getting pay checks, as was Peter Giles, Collins and Tippett were only seemy involved; almost all of this is Fripp (and Sinfield), and Fripp before he abandonned his tendency for shitty ballads.&lt;br /&gt;The decision to split up the ballads from the more chaotic music here may have made sense at the time, but it sort of hurts how the album aged, I think. "Peace" doesn't so much unify the album as remind us that we're not listening to the angrier, more violent side of the band. Those pieces are still a lot easier to take than "Cadence and Cascande" and don't really weaken the album I'd just prefer more "rock", if you know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;I understand the criticism that this is kind of repeating the debut, but I'd argue that the best tracks here are superior to the best tracks on the debut, even if they are retreading the same space. "Pictures of the City" is my candidate for the best thing this version of the band ever did (if you can even say this is the same lineup as the debut) and "The Devil's Triangle" remains one of the most daring rock adaptations of Romantic music that I've ever heard. Also, they never recorded anything like "Cat Food" ever again. It's for those three things (and the title track, I guess, even though I like it less) that I would recommend this and say it's still pretty essential prog. I mean look at the year this came out. Prog was still barely a thing. ELP was an idea, Genesis didn't know what they wanted to do, Tull were still essentially making hard rock, the Floyd were still including psychedelia and folk on their records and Yes was just getting started. I mean, aside from Crimson, I can think of maybe two or three other bands releasing music in 1970 that could be truly considered to be &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; "progressive."&lt;br /&gt;9/10 (somewhat begrudgingly)</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/4689829803769216658/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=4689829803769216658&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/4689829803769216658" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/4689829803769216658" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/05/in-wake-of-poseidon-1970-by-king-crimson.html" rel="alternate" title="In the Wake of Poseidon (1970) by King Crimson" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-7006580874249597198</id><published>2015-05-12T18:47:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-12T18:47:34.649-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1926"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Music"></category><title type="text">1926 in Music</title><content type="html">&lt;h4&gt;1.

Like all single disc compilations of a productive artist, it doesn't give us the greatest picture of his work. But what it does function as is an interesting little introduction to the changes that large jazz ensembles went through between the early '20s and 1940. And that's pretty cool to hear with a band led by the same guy. That's probably the main reason for picking this up over the separate more complete collections of his music that exist out there.&lt;br /&gt;You already &lt;a href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.ca/2014/07/jazz-2001-ken-burns.html" target="_blank"&gt;know how I feel about the miniseries&lt;/a&gt;. But what about this music?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;"Teapot Dome Blues" is pleasant big band "dixieland" (or "trad" if you prefer) jazz. It lacks any of the awesome energy and power of Armstrong's contemporaneous music. But this is still pretty early in jazz - Henderson may have had one of the first big bands after all - and it's cool to hear the emerging style. (Due to limits in recording technology the track is virtually drumless and the percussion is provided by a banjo and the odd cymbal crash, which is typical of all these 1924 recordings here.)

It has more energy than the first track.&lt;br /&gt;Henderson wasn't the first to do "Copenhagen" but this one has a great Armstrong solo that I'm sure elevates it above the original. The break is nuts too.&lt;br /&gt;"Sugar Foot Stomp" is a King Oliver tune (I believe) which is notable for being jumpier (drums!) than most of what came before it by this band. Armstrong is excellent again. That might be him yelling too.&lt;br /&gt;"The Chant" has a bonkers organ part on it. An organ! AN ORGAN!!! Okay, sorry, that just wasn't very common in 1926. The booklet screwed up and has the organ credit on the 8th track. Oops.&lt;br /&gt;"Hot Mustard" is a bouncy track with a tuba fill, which is cool. You can hear the writing getting more and more sophisticated for backing the solos. This has some of the great swooning of earlier dixieland too. Also, Henderson plays a rare piano solo.&lt;br /&gt;"Sensation" starts as a ballad, but it's a trick! That must have gone over well live. The rest of it is less interesting but the backing parts are sounding more and more like conventional big band.&lt;br /&gt;"Livery Stable Blues" is one of the oldest jazz songs there is. I still haven't managed to hear the original yet so I have no idea how this compares to it - beyond the size of the band being something like 2.5 times the size. The song certainly sounds relatively primitive compared to other tracks here.&lt;br /&gt;"My Pretty Girl" has one of the most overly rhythmic openings of any of Henderson's work from this period. It's the first song on this compilation with a vocalist. The main melody is played straight up while people do crazy dixieland-type things in the background. The song gets more sophisticated after the vocal.&lt;br /&gt;"Hot and Anxious" is rather sedate comparatively, but features a classic muted solo (where it sounds like the cornet is singing), also there's a part of this that really sounds like an early "In the Mood" - I guess that means it swings. Guitar solo alert!&lt;br /&gt;"Comin' and Goin'" sounds somewhat backwards after "Hot and Anxious." It's got a more traditional "blues" feel and feels like it belongs in the twenties.&lt;br /&gt;"Radio Rhythm" is the most aggressive and complicated track the band had recorded to date. It must have been ridiculous to play as an ensemble (especially that opening). Brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;"Oh! It Looks Like Rain" features some of those so-dirty-you-can't-believe-it lyrics that were snuck into jazz, blues and pop songs from the thirties onward. But otherwise, it's one of the least interesting songs here. It feels like a bid for a hit. There's another one of those rare Henderson piano solos.&lt;br /&gt;"King Porter Stomp" is a real oldie - it predates jazz. Apparently Goodman cribbed Henderson's arrangement and turned that into a standard, so that sucks for Henderson. It definitely swings. I'm guessing maybe Goodman's was better produced or something. This has some classic solos.&lt;br /&gt;"Queer Notions" starts off with another faux-Eastern thing but soon jumps out of that into pretty classic swing. Hawkins' solo is a classic. As is the one from the solo trumpet (whoever was playing it).&lt;br /&gt;"Can You Take It?" is one I've heard before somewhere for sure. That or its language was stolen for another song (or more). It's pretty classic swing. You can see why some people regard Henderson's band as the real the kings of swing when you listen to this.&lt;br /&gt;"Happy Feet" has a rather large band for what is mostly a quartet during the verses. It's an odd one though it gets more interesting when it nears the minute mark.&lt;br /&gt;"Big John's Special" is as classic a swing tune as it gets - it would almost be cliche if this weren't 1934.&lt;br /&gt;"Hotter than 'Ell" also swings but it's significantly 'hotter' (I'm sorry, I couldn't help myself - I think that was the intent, though). It's an excellent example of a band playing fast and sophisticated at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;"Christopher Columbus" feels like a song we should hear in a swing film. It's a little older than it sounds, apparently. The band playing is more interesting. The solos feel a little dated.&lt;br /&gt;"Grand Terrace Swing" is another class swing song wherein all the conventions are internalized to the point where it's hard to tell whether the band is moving forward or treading water. (Though the style would be popular for years after this.) On my god, a piano solo. That's like the fifth one or something.&lt;br /&gt;"Stealin' Apples" is actually drive by piano, like "Happy Feet", and we are again left wondering what happened to the band. This is actually kind of forward thinking though, as when Chu Berry (or whoever it is) comes in, the band is still missing. It's basically dixieland though, not proto-bop. It's about 2 minutes in before it sounds like big band.&lt;br /&gt;"Jim Town Blues" just jumps right into the big band thing, but sounds more sophisticated (and less obviously "swing") than some of their other tracks from this period. It sounds like there is a clear desire to move beyond swing to something else. Eldridge (or whoever) is still pretty traditional, but the arrangement does feel progressive.&lt;br /&gt;"Stampede" feels like more of a bid to stay with the trend and have something to dance to. Not my favourite.&lt;br /&gt;"Kitty on Toast" starts with a solo piano introduction that feels utterly out of place. And then the piano is joined by the rhythm and a violin!

(It eventually became the cover of one of their best-of compilations, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;The Blue Album.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;The idea involved an accompanying film, which turned out would wreak havoc with the attempts at putting out the album. The Beatles hired then up-and-coming Glyn Johns as the engineer - he would go on to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000081; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;engineer and co-produce some major records in the '70s &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;- but implying when he was hired that he was also the producer. They never informed Martin or Johns what their roles would be – were they coproducing with each other or what? Martin assumed he was the producer, as he always was. And Johns assumed he was the producer, because he had been led to believe that. Additionally the Beatles tried to rehearse in a film studio specifically so the film crew could work around them. That didn't work: Harrison quit at the very beginning of the sessions - for the second time in only a few months – because of the recording conditions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;The Beatles then attempted to record in the studios they had acquired with their new label, Apple. Harrison claimed that Clapton's presence on “While My Guitar Gently Weeps” had made the band behave like humans to each other. So, to this end he hired Billy Preston to play keyboards for the sessions – once he had returned to the band. (This served a dual purpose since the band was without a keyboard player most of the time, if they were going to play live.) The band played an enormous amount of material - though often failed to complete the performances - during these rehearsals and recording sessions, including numerous covers - as part of the “back to our roots” approach. Only a little of it has surfaced officially on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Let It Be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;and its re-release, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Naked&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;, and on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Anthology&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;, although there are apparently numerous bootlegs of the sessions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;The seriousness of the back-to-basics approach can be seen in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;infamous rooftop concert shut down by police, that instantly became iconic and has inspired numerous surprise performances by major acts throughout the ensuing years. That a band who had been screamed out of performing live a few years earlier would embrace performing live again, if only to try to save something as it was falling apart, shows either how committed they were – at the time – to the idea of a complete rejection of their pioneering studio trickery, or how desperate they were to capture the good old days. It was probably a mixture of both.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;There was no such thing as a warts-and-all / back-to-basics album before the attempt at &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Get Back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;. Until the invention of multi-tracking in the 1950s, it was a technical impossibility, let alone something that anyone would ever think of. And until psychedelia emphasized the excesses of multi-tracking in 1966 and '67, why would anyone want to forsake new technology that made you sound better? The concept was still novel in 1969. Even though the Byrds went “back” to basics by making country music in mid 1968, they did not give up studio technology, going so far as to overdub Gram Parsons out of the band after he quit. When the Rolling Stones abandoned psychedelia almost as quickly as they took it up, to re-embrace their first loves in late 1968 - and the Indian instruments on a song don't indicate a full abandonment of psychedelia - they did not forsake multi-tracking. Even CCR, the inventors of roots rock, overdubbed keyboards and extra guitar parts regularly. And if the Flamin Groovies recorded live in the studio, nobody even knew they existed so who cares what they did. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;The album, as I’ve outlined above, was ready to go; everything had been recorded. More than enough had been recorded. The problem was that the Beatles disagreed on how it should be mixed, or whether it was even releasable. McCartney wanted to release it whereas the others seemed somewhat embarrassed. They would continue to fight over it for over a year; with various versions of the album being prepared to the point where copies were almost pressed a few times. Incidentally, McCartney's interest in releasing the warts-and-all, original version of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Get Back &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;should dispel any notions of he was always about glossy, easy pop.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;So the Beatles – even though they failed in their attempt – insinuated the idea of a return to the roots as a remedy for studio excesses into the rock and roll consciousness. Zeppelin released the nearly overdub-free &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Presence &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;halfway through their career. The Clash tried to do it with &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Cut the Crap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;. There have been numerous other attempts. It is now a critics' cliché; it has basically become part of the lexicon, just like any band that is really ambitious has to attempt a &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;White Album &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;style kitchen sink thing - on one CD or two. If a band gets totally out of control in the studio, the reaction of everyone is that they should go back to basics - even if the result rarely is overdub free. And this comes from the Beatles attempt at making &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Get Back &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;in the near-death throes of their existence. Perhaps the fact that it was a failure is even more prescient, given how few bands have been able to take the concept to its logical end in a world full of endless overdubbing and editing temptations.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;After &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Get Back &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;had been rejected at least &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;three times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;, and the Beatles had all started making their own records, their manager sought to make a little money. Hiring Phil Spector to create an album out of those sessions – especially the rooftop performance – Allan Klein - sometimes credited as acting on behalf of Harrison and Lennon and sometimes not - essentially put together the antithesis of the original album. Now there's all sorts of disagreement about who was in favour of it and who wasn't but the end result was that &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Let It Be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;definitely wasn't &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Get Back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;. Yes, a couple of the songs still retain their origins as live-in-the-studio songs sans overdubs but even the ones not obviously effected had studio chatter mixed in from other sessions - as with this version of “Get Back,” for example. It's hard to know whose album this was but the end result was that McCartney quit the band a week after finding out about it and thereby gained, at least temporarily, the ire of a lot of fans - who were unaware of the number of times the others had quit, or hadn't quite put together that Lennon's burgeoning solo career was leading to this eventually. The only Beatle to actually play on the Spector sessions for the album - in addition to a complete remix of the material, Spector recorded an orchestra and choir - was Starr, who re-recorded his drums for a couple songs. So we know McCartney didn’t like it and he was by this point the dominant voice. We know some people claim Lennon liked it – and Lennon did admit in interviews to liking some of what Spector did – but it doesn’t fit with anything he was doing musically at the time: his albums with Ono, his first solo album, his singles. Harrison likely approved – whether or not he personally hired Spector for this Beatles album – because he immediately hired Spector to produce his next solo album, the first one to focus on songs. And Starr explicitly approved by being the only Beatle to actually participate in the new recording sessions. It says it’s a “new phase” Beatles album on the cover, whatever that means.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;So what do we do with it? It’s a Beatles album, as it was released before the official breakup to the group, credited to the group and performed by the group. But it doesn’t represent the intentions of the dominant songwriter of the group’s late period, and may or may not have represented the intentions of the band’s other main songwriter - since he wasn't participating at all at this point - and it doesn’t represent the intentions of the group’s normal producer either. It is a Beatles album curated by the two least significant Beatles, in one sense. It was only named after the last Beatles’ single likely because that was the easiest way to move records. “Dear Beatles fans. Here is the album to follow up that single you are listening to all the time.” It is a “back to basics” album that is full of overdubs and editing; an utter contradiction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;But I don’t think that invalidates it. Until the release of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Anthology 3 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;in 1996 - and really until the release of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Let It Be Naked &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;in 2003 - this was the only official version of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Get Back &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;that we ever received. (There have been bootlegs.) And while it is as far from the Beatles’ intentions with that project as nearly anything could be, it still lets us hear at least some of what would have been absolutely innovative for spring 1969: the first ever “back to basics” rock album, which has inspired numerous attempts at shedding the studio-as-instrument approach since. And, despite the plethora of covers and jams recorded for the album, and despite the infighting, it’s not like the band or their lead songwriter took the time off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;“Two of Us” is a folk-rock song by McCartney that really does fit the original concept of the abandoned album, only having chatter overdubbed at the beginning to differentiate it from its initial “finished” version. This final version is slower and softer than earlier run-throughs, but still contains enough charm – I think – and enough of the now typical Beatles unconventionality to appeal: changes in metre, uneven phrasing, and the like; by now standard Beatles tropes. It sounds like little else they had recorded to date. (It actually sounds, to me, like it could have fit in on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Help! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;but it’s more mature stylistically.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;“Dig a Pony” is an impassioned love song by Lennon with mostly nonsense words; he repeatedly dismissed it over the years. Again, it manages to preserve the original feel of the project, despite the remix - which omits two parts of the original version. It is the first of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Let It Be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;tracks to be taken from the rooftop concert. Pollack notes:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The tune makes broad and spicy gestures of contour. The verse starts off with a balanced arch that covers a full octave but ends up with a second upward sweep of that arch left hanging in air, just begging for some release or relief from the refrain. The refrain obligingly picks up where the verse had left things and proceeds to blow the roof off in terms of range; the downbeat of the refrain momentarily establishes a new melodic highpoint just above where the verse tops out, but then, in the second phrase, the tune jumps up practically a full octave to top out in falsetto on the C# eight and a half steps above middle C.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;It’s this kind of rawness that I think discouraged the Beatles from following through with their intentions. They meant to do it initially - or at least McCartney did - but when they sat back and listened, with years of studio perfectionism hanging over their shoulders, they heard mistakes by the ton. Now we may like those mistakes – I do – but we are are also listening in a world where &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Let it Be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;is a famous record, which was not the world of the decision not to release &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Get Back &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;was made in. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;This version of “Across the Universe” was slowed down for an orchestra and choir. The overproduction also includes more effects - in addition to the effects the Beatles added in 1968 - so you can’t hear most of the original band, or the fan backing vocals. This version has become a radio staple; it is the version everyone knows and presumably loves. Lennon apparently preferred this one. My attitude is that this song had no place on this record but on the other hand Spector didn’t exactly destroy it, like he destroyed some others (see below).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;The shortest Harrison song that the Beatles ever used – “I Me Mine” was virtually doubled in length by Spector and also given the full orchestra treatment. It is about ego, apparently. It features some fairly good playing by the composer but it was created completely independently of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Get Back &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;project – recorded a full year later – and with full intent to overdub. (There are many even prior to Spector’s, as both Harrison and McCartney added additional parts.) Though I am a fan of the music - not of the lyrics - I can’t help but think it doesn’t belong, despite being the last “official” Beatles song to be finished.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;“Dig It” is one of the innumerable jams and song fragments recorded during the &lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;sessions. Why this song was picked over others – and why this version was picked over other, longer versions of “Dig It” itself – I don't know. Some versions ran to seven minutes but usually broke down. The lyrics changed from version to version - with Lennon spouting off the band’s catalogue during one take. It was edited together from two distinct performances by Spector and nobody really knows why. It’s one of the reasons this album is looked at as a bit of a mess.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;The album version of “Let It Be” features the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;other &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;guitar solo more prominently – Harrison recorded two, an original one and an overdub when they were thinking of releasing it as a single – fewer backing vocals and new and louder orchestration to replace Martin's original, subtle scoring. Most of us Beatles snobs prefer the single version just because. (Really, because it was mostly a band product and it has taste.) I think even with the hatchet job the song still stands up. It’s one of the highlights of the album.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;“Maggie Mae” was the first “cover” to appear on a Beatles album in years. It was a joke they recorded as one of innumerable covers to “warm up.” Earlier versions of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Get Back &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;contained other covers that they attempted more seriously. It is strange that this one was included because it was pretty incomplete compared to many of the other covers they performed back in January of 1969. However, a version of “Maggie Mae” was included by the Beatles themselves in the planned releases of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Get Back &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;- though in a different part of the album sequence - so there must be some reason why it is here; some attempt to make a kind of statement about where the band was at. Or just for fun. Or for sequencing purposes. I can’t figure it out.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;For me, “I've Got a Feeling” is one of the highlights of this album. It combines parts of two separate songs - one by McCartney, one by Lennon as was usual by this time - but it is the better for it. It’s actually the first time the two had combined song-fragments to create a new song like this since “Baby You’re a Rich Man” in the summer of 1967 – rather than combining whole songs with fragments and the like, as they had on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;The Beatles &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Abbey Road&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;. The recording is another rooftop performance and as such, holds at least somewhat with the original concept. It’s probably my favourite song on the album and proof, for me, that they were capable of still being a pretty decent live band after years in the studio.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;“One After 909” was actually a song from their earliest days. They thought about including it on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;With the Beatles &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;even though it had been written something like six years prior to those sessions. At this point they were doing their own oldies as well as those of others. It was their attempt to write a “train song” back in the '50s when such things were popular. The recording is another one from the rooftop concert. It’s certainly way louder and rawer than what they attempted in 1963, or 1960 for that matter. But otherwise it does give you a good sense of the kind of problems occurring in the band that January. McCartney contributed the concept and most of the new material. Lennon barely contributed anything. Of the stuff he and Harrison – and even McCartney – did contribute, most of the band couldn’t agree on. So they played covers and even resorted to playing songs of their own that they didn’t even like. Given that, I am at least impressed by the performance, which is far rawer than the original version - which can be heard on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Anthology &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;along with many of the outtakes I am referring to.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;“The Long and Winding Road” is the most controversial track on the album as it features the most glaring intervention from Spector along with that on “I Me Mine”: a huge orchestra and choir and effects. It was one of the main reasons why McCartney publicly quit when he found out about the release of this album. If you think it's sappy you should listen to the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Anthology &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;version which is considerably less so. The version we all know is not the right version but there’s no way around that now. It’s even harder for us to go back and erase, as it were, our memories of this version to hear the original, to decide whether it is actually not a sappy ballad, but rather a good ballad. I don’t know that I’ve been able to do that. It was supposedly an attempt to write in the style of Ray Charles’ poppier ballads.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;“For You Blue” is Harrison trying to write a traditional blues song - with not so bluesy lyrics - and it features Lennon's debut on the lap-steel - a steel guitar played on the lap, funnily enough. It’s as straightforward for the Beatles as it gets. But it’s still relatively charming. Harrison re-recorded his vocal but the chatter was put in by Spector. At least it doesn’t feature an orchestra for no apparent reason like the other Harrison contribution. I think Lennon acquits himself fairly well on the lap steel, which is somewhat of a surprise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;The album version of “Get Back” features all sorts of dialogue not recorded at the time. Otherwise it is actually the same as the single released a year previously - just a remix. So there’s not much to choose from between the two versions, which begs the question, why did Spector include the single version of this song when he created a new version of “Let It Be”? I don’t know. I don’t think anyone does. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Let It Be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;was the first thing the Beatles released in ages – except &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Yellow Submarine &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;of course – that can really be criticized by the standards of the time, and can be considered inessential in terms of rock music history. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Get Back &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;would have stood up amongst their best work – I am convinced – as yet another path-breaking record featuring (mostly) strong songs. But &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Let It Be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;is not &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Get Back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;. And as such, it has to be viewed somewhat as the group's nadir - though, I think, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Magical Mystery Tour &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="color: #000081; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;could also be viewed that way&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;. But as a nadir, it still features a lot of great music and four songs that have become part of the canon of “radio staples”, if not standards out right. Pick your favourite band from the '60s and compare &lt;/span&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT;"&gt;Let It Be &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT;"&gt;to the worst album of their career. Who wins?

I mean, I fucking hate them. Though not as much as I hate the Yankees. But I feel like I remember this series like it was yesterday. (But I more remember where I was than the actual moments of the game.) Among the best baseball playoffs I've seen in my adult life. (There have been a few that were better in my mind, such as Diamondbacks / Yankees, but not many.) This was a great series and the film does a good job of getting us to  understand how incredible it was, in part by focusing on the players,  for the most part. Millar in particular seems to have had boundless  confidence and it helps that the players documented it themselves.&lt;br /&gt;One huge problem with the film is its self-importance. The opening credits are ridiculous (and rival pretty much only &lt;i&gt;June 17, 1994&lt;/i&gt; in the series for ridiculousness) and the music is often utterly over the top (not to mention cliche) - it actually descends into parody.&lt;br /&gt;Another weird thing is the teeny tiny bits of Bill Simmons "interviewing" comedian Lenny Clarke, I guess trying to provide context for those who didn't watch it, but they're so brief and so intermittent that's hard to know why they included them instead of, say, narration. (Well, we know why, Simmons is the exec producer. But still...)&lt;br /&gt;But this is another one of those films where the subject matter overcomes clunky direction.

He ran the year before I was born, but despite that, I know the legend/myth just like most Canadians my age. Here's the real connection I have to the story:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dIxGHX37GFc/VU-HI-hrGvI/AAAAAAAAAT4/YgMlawyioms/s1600/F1000022.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="214" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dIxGHX37GFc/VU-HI-hrGvI/AAAAAAAAAT4/YgMlawyioms/s320/F1000022.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This is the view from the memorial outside of Thunder Bay. I apologize for the shitty picture. I didn't take a picture of the memorial...because? I guess there wasn't a view...&lt;br /&gt;But I didn't know the story this well, so this was still a new experience for me. It's interesting to see how different something like this was before the internet. It's incredible to me that people didn't know about this when he started, and it's also worth thinking about how nothing has really changed - people always want to use things for their own purposes, be it political gain, money, or other things.&lt;br /&gt;I guess because this is such a fundamental Canadian myth for those of us my age, that I was barely able to keep myself together while watching it. (A hangover might have helped with that.) I have no idea if it's this moving for non-Canadians, but seeing the full story is kind of overwhelming: I'm filled with pride, sadness, and a whole host of other emotions.&lt;br /&gt;The film itself is far from perfect. And that makes sense given Nash and his co-director's lack of filmmaking experience. But despite some clunky moments - particularly in the early goings, when some of the montages and shots are really, really cliche and/or weak - the story is so powerful (at least to a Canadian) that you really don't care.&lt;br /&gt;8/10&lt;br /&gt;PS Good job Quebec.

At times it also feels like it's about the Steinbrenners. There are plenty of interviews with people affected by this change, there are the famous clips, there's talk about how they spend money, but it doesn't really add up. But they don't dwell very long on Steinbrenner's terrible record as an owner before he was suspended (that gets maybe 5 minutes) and the filmmakers seem unsure whether this is about the move, about the Steinbrenners or about the Yankees. It tries to be all of these things and unfortunately that gives us a really unbalanced film that fails to make me care about this move, &lt;i&gt;at all&lt;/i&gt;.

Just an absolute ton. This set collects the 23rd through 28th, all of which were written at the same time, as one cycle or collection. They are considered by most people to be the birth of the modern String Quartet and wikipedia tells me that the form established here didn't really change for 200 years, which is insane.&lt;br /&gt;I am a sucker for String Quartets and I can't say that I've heard any earlier than these in my life. So earlier Quartets would probably strike my ears as exceptionally primitive.&lt;br /&gt;I am tempted to write down my thoughts about all of them but other people have said it much better than me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This cannot be overstated. The six string quartets of Opus 20 are as important in the history of music, and had as radically a transforming effect on the very field of musical possibility itself, as Beethoven's Third Symphony would 33 years later.&lt;br /&gt;- Ron Drummond&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Every page of the six quartets of op. 20 is of historic and aesthetic importance... there is perhaps no single or sextuple opus in the history of instrumental music which has achieved so much.&lt;br /&gt;- Donald Tovey&lt;/blockquote&gt;I cannot add to that.&lt;br /&gt;10/10&lt;br /&gt;PS The beginning of one of the repeating phrases in the second of these quartets sounds exactly like one of the themes from the &lt;i&gt;Star Wars&lt;/i&gt; score.</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/2014132726563843946/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=2014132726563843946&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/2014132726563843946" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/2014132726563843946" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/05/joseph-haydn-string-quartets-op-20-sun.html" rel="alternate" title="Joseph Haydn: String Quartets Op. 20 'Sun' (2011) by the London Haydn Quartet" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-4815954421866575603</id><published>2015-05-08T17:00:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-08T17:00:00.897-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1780s"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Classical"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Music"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Oratorio"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="String Quartet"></category><title type="text">Joseph Haydn: Die Sieben letzten Worte (2014) by Cuarteto Casals</title><content type="html">This is supposedly an "instrumental" oratorio. Haydn first wrote it for orchestra (with no vocals!). Then he adapted it for String Quartet. Then he adapted it for Choir (as if it was an actual oratorio). Then he "approved" an adaptation for solo piano, but apparently didn't write that one himself. This is the String Quartet version, obviously. It is considered the most popular version of the piece, which I guess makes me okay with listening to it over the orchestral original.&lt;br /&gt;I am a sucker for String Quartets and Haydn is the Father of them. (He didn't invent them, but he was the first composer to write a lot of them, and to establish the conventions of the genre.) Given the piece's origins, it is not a conventional Quartet: it's nine movements long, for example, instead of the usual three. The music is played every Holy Week in Cadiz, and has been for centuries apparently, so it makes sense to hear a Spanish ensemble's version.&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what this is &lt;i&gt;supposed&lt;/i&gt; to sound like but I absolutely love this recording. It strikes me as rather sophisticated for its era - it sort of sounds like a collection of separate pieces, like a cycle - and my ears would have a hard time dating it, if I didn't know when it was written. The music itself is gorgeous and I can understand why it's so popular.&lt;br /&gt;It's an absolute masterpiece, and I have trouble putting into words how much I like it.&lt;br /&gt;10/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/4815954421866575603/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=4815954421866575603&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/4815954421866575603" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/4815954421866575603" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/05/joseph-haydn-die-sieben-letzten-worte.html" rel="alternate" title="Joseph Haydn: Die Sieben letzten Worte (2014) by Cuarteto Casals" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-4801365253482583652</id><published>2015-05-07T20:26:00.005-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-07T20:26:50.016-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2009"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Crime"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Drama"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Israel"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Movies"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Religion"></category><title type="text">Ajami (2009, Scandar Copti, Yaron Shani)</title><content type="html">This is an ambitious, compelling, complex portrait of daily life (with a little crime thrown in for good measure) in Israel. In its ambition, it's trying to be &lt;i&gt;Short Cuts&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Traffic&lt;/i&gt; but in execution it's more &lt;i&gt;Babel&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Crash&lt;/i&gt; (okay, it's not that bad). Though the actors appear to be amateurs, they are very compelling. As others have noted, the filmmakers don't take sides in the religious / ethnic conflict at all, it's just taken as context for the story. The problem with the film, and the thing that prevents it from being a masterpiece is the end, which is really contrived and which is unfortunately shown multiple times. Otherwise, this is well worth seeing and much more realistic than so many of these multiple narrative films.&lt;br /&gt;8/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/4801365253482583652/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=4801365253482583652&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/4801365253482583652" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/4801365253482583652" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/05/ajami-2009-scandar-copti-yaron-shani.html" rel="alternate" title="Ajami (2009, Scandar Copti, Yaron Shani)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-356063589915974740</id><published>2015-05-06T20:48:00.002-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-06T20:48:55.066-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2010"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="30 for 30"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Boxing"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Hip Hop"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Rap"></category><title type="text">30 for 30: One Night in Vegas (2010, Reggie Rock Bythewood)</title><content type="html">I thought this series was about sports...&lt;br /&gt;I am a white male who was born to middle class parents in Toronto in the early 1980s.

It's a great cautionary tale - because imagine what it's like for kids today - Mo'ne Davis - if it was this bad for them in 1982. It reminds us that, no matter how excited we might get over kids' amateur sports, these are still children; they are still very impressionable and they don't have our thick skins (though many adults don't either). Honestly, I feel for these kids. I wouldn't have wanted this either.&lt;br /&gt;What should be one of the best of the series is hampered by some really cliche narration - oh science that script is terrible - and this weird decision to put some kind of effect on the digital video, as if to try to make it less obviously different from the Super 8 the archival footage was shot on.&lt;br /&gt;Still very much worth your time, just not quite as good as it could have been.&lt;br /&gt;7/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/6906279514705474560/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=6906279514705474560&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/6906279514705474560" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/6906279514705474560" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/05/30-for-30-little-big-men-2010-al.html" rel="alternate" title="30 for 30: Little Big Men (2010, Al Szymanski)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-599545213080439848</id><published>2015-05-06T18:31:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-06T18:31:08.845-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2010"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="30 for 30"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Baseball"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Basketball"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Michael Jordan"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Minor League"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Retirement"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sports"></category><title type="text">30 for 30: Jordan Rides the Bus (2010, Ron Shelton)</title><content type="html">This is a fascinating documentary which, for anyone who hasn't yet seen it, should put to bed any idea that Jordan was "suspended" for gambling during his first retirement.&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I wished I had paid more attention at the time - this is utterly fascinating.

But it's an utterly fascinating portrait of one of the most competitive people we have a historical record of, trying to do something and failing.&lt;br /&gt;And despite his (somewhat deserved) reputation as an asshole, he comes off looking a lot less like an asshole. &lt;br /&gt;7/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/599545213080439848/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=599545213080439848&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/599545213080439848" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/599545213080439848" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/05/30-for-30-jordan-rides-bus-2010-ron.html" rel="alternate" title="30 for 30: Jordan Rides the Bus (2010, Ron Shelton)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-1130658534752596362</id><published>2015-05-03T21:32:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-03T21:32:43.766-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1994"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2010"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="30 for 30"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Documentary"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="OJ Simpson"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sports"></category><title type="text">30 for 30: June 17th, 1994 (2010, Brett Morgen)</title><content type="html">This is a fascinating, ambitious but flawed attempt at putting the OJ Simpson chase into some kind of greater sports context, and perhaps to serve as a document for those people who were not alive to witness this.&lt;br /&gt;Like most people my age and older, I remember this event rather well. What I didn't remember was how it corresponded with the Rangers' Cup parade (I had stopped watching hockey the previous year), Game 5 of the NBA Finals (I didn't watch basketball at the time), Arnold Palmer's last time at the US Open (golf is terrible), the opening of the World Cup of Soccer (soccer is terrible, but not as terrible as golf) and some baseball games (finally something I cared about!). The film does a good job of showing how important this seemed - I can't tell whether it's mocking that sense of import or really taking it so seriously. In retrospect to me it is absolutely shocking that they interrupted a game of the NBA Finals to show a &lt;i&gt;car chase&lt;/i&gt;, as if the car chase was September 11th or something. (Obviously they couldn't know that, but it's incredible the lack of proportion the TV media showed that day.)&lt;br /&gt;And it's interesting to think of how this changed how we watched TV. Other people have suggested how the OJ chase and trial started sensationalist television in the United States. I don't know if that's true, but it definitely feels like it was a major tipping point along the path to where we are now, where non news dominates news all the time.&lt;br /&gt;The film captures a lot of this and would be a masterpiece only it's a little too self-important (the opening feels like I'm about to watch the most important movie ever) and it's attempt at artfulness are often slightly more awkward than they should be. Here's a nitpick: why do they play with time? These things unfolded in real time so why mess around with the time - sometimes it's eastern, sometimes it's pacific. It's maddening.&lt;br /&gt;8/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/1130658534752596362/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=1130658534752596362&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/1130658534752596362" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/1130658534752596362" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/05/30-for-30-june-17th-1994-2010-brett.html" rel="alternate" title="30 for 30: June 17th, 1994 (2010, Brett Morgen)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-7607473882027881829</id><published>2015-05-03T19:40:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-03T19:40:44.810-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2012"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Art"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Artists"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="China"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Documentary"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Human Rights"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Movies"></category><title type="text">Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry (2012, Alison Klayman)</title><content type="html">I had no idea who Ai Weiwei was until I saw his show at the AGO maybe two years ago. I can't say I'm up on contemporary art but I was really impressed at both the ballsiness and the variety of his work. This film is more about his role as a political dissident in China, though it is also about his career as a celebrity artist. The documentary is pretty biased, but that's not a big deal given what he is up to. Basically, even if you don't like his art, if you think he is some kind of charlatan or artistic fraud, you can't ignore what he's doing to bring attention to what is happening in China or how he has turned twitter into a tool for social protest and awareness to a greater extent than most people.&lt;br /&gt;This documentary is flawed - it uses the stupid "camera shutter click" noise &lt;i&gt;way&lt;/i&gt; too much for example - but the subject is compelling enough, and the documentary is chronological enough that it doesn't feel as directionless as its style and form at first suggest.&lt;br /&gt;Certainly of interest if you are interested in Ai, if you are interested in China, or if you are interested in the intersection of art and politics.&lt;br /&gt;7/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/7607473882027881829/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=7607473882027881829&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/7607473882027881829" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/7607473882027881829" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/05/ai-weiwei-never-sorry-2012-alison.html" rel="alternate" title="Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry (2012, Alison Klayman)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-9025877103597052850</id><published>2015-05-03T19:31:00.002-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-03T19:33:47.322-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Basketball"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Draft"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Greatest of All Time"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Hall of Fame"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="NBA"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Raptors"></category><title type="text">The Top 5 Raptors Draft Picks of All Time</title><content type="html">The other day, I covered 10 of the "best" 15 draft picks the Raptors have made.

I will be using a different format for covering these players, as they all have (sometimes quite weak) Hall of Fame cases, which can't be said of any of the players covered in the earlier post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.ca/2015/04/raptors-best-draft-picks.html" target="_blank"&gt;See picks 6-16&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5.

In his draft year, Stoudamire is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;9th in games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;5th&lt;/b&gt; in minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;6th in points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;12th in boards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2nd&lt;/b&gt; in assists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;31st in FG% (min 100 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4th&lt;/b&gt; in 3P% (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;3rd&lt;/b&gt; in FT% (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;3rd&lt;/b&gt; in MPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;5th&lt;/b&gt; in PPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;16th in RPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1st&lt;/b&gt; in APG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;8th in WS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;16th in WS per 48 (min 100 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Mighty Mouse definitely turned out to be a great pick in his draft class, turning into one of the better players to enter the NBA that year. But, though he is fondly remembered by fans, Stoudamire was far from an All-Time Great and could see his spot on this list usurped by DeRozan or Hibbert pretty soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How did he get away?&lt;/b&gt; Traded with Carlos Rogers and Walt Williams to the Trail Blazers for Kenny Anderson, Gary Trent, Alvin Williams, two 1st Rounders in 1998 (Bryce Drew, Mirsad Turkcan), and a 2nd Rounder in 1998 (Tyson Wheeler). So, uh, that was a massive deal. Kind of eel like maybe we won it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4.

In his draft year, Jamison is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4th&lt;/b&gt; in games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4th&lt;/b&gt; in minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4th&lt;/b&gt; in points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2nd&lt;/b&gt; in boards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;11th in assists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;17th in FG% (min 100 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;17th in 3P% (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;23rd in FT% (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;5th&lt;/b&gt; in MPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4th&lt;/b&gt; in PPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2nd&lt;/b&gt; in RPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;19th in APG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;5th&lt;/b&gt; in Win Shares&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;8th in WS per 48&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Jamison is pretty close to the 4th best player in his draft and he was drafted 4th overall. Unfortunately for him, the 5th overall player had the better career. Fortunately for the Raptors, they immediately traded Jamison for that player, Vince.&lt;br /&gt;Jamison has had an odd career: he's got enough longevity that some people will likely argue that he belongs in the Hall of Fame (despite his poor luck at almost always playing on bad teams), on the other hand by some metrics (VORP), Camby was more important to his teams than Jamison, that's just one example of likely a large number of players.&lt;br /&gt;Jamison was unlucky in who he played for, and that will likely affect the perception of his legacy of a good but not quite ever great player.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How did he get away?&lt;/b&gt; Traded to the Warriors for Vince Carter plus cash immediately after getting drafted. Oops. (That's an oops for Golden State.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3.

In his draft year, Camby is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;7th in games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;9th in minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;12th in points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1st&lt;/b&gt; in boards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10th in assists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10th in FG% (min 100 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;24th in 3P% (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;25th in FT% (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10th in MPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;12th in PPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1st&lt;/b&gt; in RPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;13th in APG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;6th in Win Shares&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;7th in WS per 48&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;By how he compares to his draft class in he above categories,  Camby looks like a bit of a semi-bust, not a full on bust, but a least a  semi-bust. And that's probably why he wasn't included on that list on  TSN.ca. But these are almost entirely offensive categories. Defense  isn't mentioned (BPG for example) except for rebounds, which are about  2/3 defensive and 1/3 offensive usually. If we just focus on the above  numbers, and not on some other notable things, Camby looks pedestrian  and a bad pick at 2. (Obviously if the draft could be done in the full  possession of knowledge of the future, the 13th overall player would  have gone 1st.)&lt;br /&gt;But, though he never won the DPOY, Camby was, by  two separate metrics, among the best defenders in the league, perhaps  even the best, for a number of years. Unfortunately for Camby, the way  we think about defense has evolved only after his prime, so he will  likely not get a lot of respect from HOF voters. He should get a least  some respect from us, and until Hibbert gets a few more (consistent)  years under his belt, Camby stands as the best defender the Raps ever  drafted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;How did he get away?&lt;/b&gt; Traded to the Knicks for Sean Marks, Charles Oakley and cashmoney. Ooof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Chris Bosh, PF/C, drafted 4th overall, 2003&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Career:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;12 seasons, all quality&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;35.9 MPG &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;16,179P, 7,202R, 898B, 1,667A, 694S in 30,158 minutes over 840 games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Per 36: 19.3P, 8.6R, 1.1B, 2A, .8S&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;.495 FG%, .326 3P%, .799 FT%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;20.6 PER, .571 TS%, 99.6 WS, .159 WS per 48 minutes, 25.6 VORP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Playoffs:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;35.2 MPG &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1,388P, 665R, 102B, 119A, 73S in 3,131 minutes over 89 games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Per 36: 16P, 7.6R, 1.2B, 1.4A, .8S&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;.473 FG%, .386 3P%, .8 FT%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;18.4 PER, .553 TS%, 9.4 Win Shares, .144 WS per 48, 2.4 VORP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rights traded once in his prime&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Accomplishments:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 5 player by PER ('10), Top 10 twice ('08)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 10 Offensive Player by Offensive Rating once ('06)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 10 in MPG once&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 10 in Usage %age twice &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 10 in Points twice&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 10 in PPG thrice &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 5 in Free Throws once, Top 10 four times&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 5 in FTA once, Top 10 four times&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 10 in Defensive Rebounds thrice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 10 in Rebounds once&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 10 in RPG twice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 10 in Offensive Win Shares once&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 All Star Games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 2nd Team All Star, All Rookie &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;Great Teams:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;3rd best player on two Champions ('12, '13 Heat) and two Runners Up ('11, '14 Heat)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Olympic Champion ('08)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;World Champion Bronze Medallist ('06)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drafted immediately behind Melo and immediately ahead of Wade and Chris Kaman; other NBA players drafted below Bosh include David West (18th), Josh Howard (29th), Mo Williams (47th), Kyle Korver (51st) and lots of others. In his draft year, Bosh is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4th&lt;/b&gt; in games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;3rd&lt;/b&gt; in minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4th&lt;/b&gt; in points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1st&lt;/b&gt; in boards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;11th in assists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4th&lt;/b&gt; in FG% (min 100 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;24th in 3P%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;11th in FT% (min 100 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4th&lt;/b&gt; in MPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4th&lt;/b&gt; in PPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1st&lt;/b&gt; in RPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;14th in APG (min 100 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;3rd&lt;/b&gt; in Win Shares&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;3rd&lt;/b&gt; in WS per 48 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Just like Jamison, Bosh has been outshone by the player drafted immediately below him. However, unlike Jamison, Bosh's fate is now tied to Wade's, so it's harder to compare and contrast the two. This draft is widely held to be one of the greatest ever, so it's a testament to his career that Bosh comes out as the 3rd or 4th best player regardless of where he was drafted. (Who'd rather have had Melo at this point?) Also, Bosh is the first person on this list we can say with pretty good certainty is going to the Hall of Fame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How did he get away?&lt;/b&gt; Rights traded to the Heat for two 2011 1st Rounders (Norris Cole, Valanciunas).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Tracy McGrady, SG/SF, drafted 9th overall, 1997&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Career: &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;15 seasons, 13 quality&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;32.7 MPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;18,381P, 4,161A, 1,136S, 5,276R, 807B in 30,658 minutes over 938 games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Per 36: 19.6P, 4.4A, 1.2S, 5.6R, .9B&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;13th All Time in Usage %age&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;21st All Time in Box Plus Minus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;21st All time in Offensive Box Plus Minus&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;.435 FG%, .338 3P%, .746 FT%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;22.1 PER, .519 TS%, 97.3 WS, .152 WS per 48, 50.6 VORP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Playoffs:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;34.5 MPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1,109P, 249A, 53S, 286R, 47B in 1,724 minutes over 50 games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Per 36: 23.2P, 5.2A, 1.1S, 6R, 1B&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;.426 FG%, .29 3P%, .757 FT%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;23.4 PER, .512 TS%, 4.5 WS, .125 WS per 48, 1.8 VORP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Traded twice in his prime and once after&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&amp;nbsp;Accomplishments:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most Improved Player ('01)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best Player by PER ('03), Top 5 ('01, '02, '04)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best Player by Win Shares Per 48 Minutes ('03)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best Player by Box Plus Minus ('03)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Best Offensive Player by Offensive Box Plus Minus ('03, '04)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 5 Player by VORP ('02, '03, '04, '05), Top 10 ('01, '07) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 5 in Minutes once&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 5 in MPG once, Top 10 twice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Led the league in Usage %age twice, Top 5 six times, Top 10 seven times&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 5 in Points thrice, Top 10 six times&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Led league in PPG twice, Top 5 thrice, Top 10 eight times &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 5 in Field Goals five times, Top 10 six times&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 5 in FGA six times&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 5 in 3 Pointers twice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 5 in 3PA twice, Top 10 thrice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 5 in Free Throws once Top 10 four times&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 5in FTA once, Top 10 four times&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 10 in Assist %age once &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 10 in Steals once&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 10 in SPG once &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 10 in Blocks once&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 10 in Turnover %age once &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Led the league in Offensive Win Shares once, Top 10 four times&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 5 in Defensive Win Shares once&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Top 5 in Win Shares once, Top 10 thrice&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;7 All Star Game appearances&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 1st Team All Stars, 3 2nd Team, 2 3rd Team&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Great Teams:&lt;/h3&gt;None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drafted immediately behind Adonal Foyle and immediately ahead of Danny Fortson. (Phew.) Notable NBA player drafted below McGrady begin and end with Stephen Jackson (42nd). In his draft year, McGrady is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;3rd&lt;/b&gt; in games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;3rd&lt;/b&gt; in minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2nd&lt;/b&gt; in points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2nd&lt;/b&gt; in boards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;3rd&lt;/b&gt; in assists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;17th in FG% (min 100 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;14th in 3P% (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;21st in FT% (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2nd&lt;/b&gt; in MPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;1st&lt;/b&gt; in PPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4th&lt;/b&gt; in RPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;3rd&lt;/b&gt; in APG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;3rd&lt;/b&gt; in Win Shares&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4th&lt;/b&gt; in WS per 48 (min 100 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;So, um, that was the right choice.&amp;nbsp; The only reason T-Mac wasn't the best player in his draft is because Tim Duncan went first overall that year. The only reason he looks like the 3rd best player is because Chauncey Billups had fewer injury problems and was lucky enough to get traded to the Pistons.&lt;br /&gt;The idea that the Raps have drafted a better player than T-Mac is patently absurd. Bosh is great, but he was never this dominant. And nobody else is worth mentioning. and in case all you remember is poor old beaten-up-by-injuries, just look at this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2,407P, 411A, 124S, 488R, 59B in 2954 minutes over 75 games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;.457 FG%, .386 3P%, .793 FT%, .564 TS%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30.3 PER&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;This is &lt;a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;amp;match=single&amp;amp;type=totals&amp;amp;per_minute_base=36&amp;amp;per_poss_base=100&amp;amp;lg_id=NBA&amp;amp;is_playoffs=N&amp;amp;year_min=&amp;amp;year_max=&amp;amp;franch_id=&amp;amp;season_start=1&amp;amp;season_end=-1&amp;amp;age_min=0&amp;amp;age_max=99&amp;amp;height_min=0&amp;amp;height_max=99&amp;amp;shoot_hand=&amp;amp;birth_country_is=Y&amp;amp;birth_country=&amp;amp;birth_state=&amp;amp;college_id=&amp;amp;is_active=&amp;amp;debut_yr_nba_start=&amp;amp;debut_yr_nba_end=&amp;amp;debut_yr_aba_start=&amp;amp;debut_yr_aba_end=&amp;amp;is_hof=&amp;amp;is_as=&amp;amp;as_comp=gt&amp;amp;as_val=&amp;amp;award=&amp;amp;pos_is_g=Y&amp;amp;pos_is_gf=Y&amp;amp;pos_is_f=Y&amp;amp;pos_is_fg=Y&amp;amp;pos_is_fc=Y&amp;amp;pos_is_c=Y&amp;amp;pos_is_cf=Y&amp;amp;qual=&amp;amp;c1stat=g&amp;amp;c1comp=gt&amp;amp;c1val=41&amp;amp;c2stat=per&amp;amp;c2comp=gt&amp;amp;c2val=30&amp;amp;c3stat=&amp;amp;c3comp=gt&amp;amp;c3val=&amp;amp;c4stat=&amp;amp;c4comp=gt&amp;amp;c4val=&amp;amp;c5stat=&amp;amp;c5comp=gt&amp;amp;c6mult=1.0&amp;amp;c6stat=&amp;amp;order_by=per" target="_blank"&gt;the 17th greatest offensive regular season in NBA history&lt;/a&gt;. It happened in 2002-03. It was T-Mac at his best. People will say T-Mac never won a playoff series and so somehow he wasn't that great. That's stupid, particularly in a 30 team league and particularly given the injury history of both T-Mac and his best teammates. And &lt;a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/ORL/2003.html" target="_blank"&gt;look at his team that year&lt;/a&gt;, what the hell was he supposed to do with that?&lt;br /&gt;There is zero debate about who the best Raptors draft pick of all time is, despite what TSN would tell you.&lt;br /&gt;There shouldn't be much debate about whether or not T-Mac makes the Hall of Fame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/9025877103597052850/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=9025877103597052850&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/9025877103597052850" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/9025877103597052850" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/05/the-top-5-raptors-draft-picks-of-all.html" rel="alternate" title="The Top 5 Raptors Draft Picks of All Time" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-7087685332119286562</id><published>2015-05-02T20:11:00.003-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-02T20:11:50.939-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2010"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Levon Helm"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Movies"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Music"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Slice of Life"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="The Band"></category><title type="text">Ain't in It for My Health (2010, Jacob Hatley)</title><content type="html">This is a kind of directionless but, at times, moving portrait of part of one of the last years of Levon Helm's life. He's struggling to continue to perform music while he deals with what might be a return of his throat cancer. The film isn't really sure what it wants to be: we get a portrait of him at home, a little bit of him on the road, some history about The Band and his feelings toward some of the members, but all of this feels like the filmmaker is just sort of probing here and there. Though seeing into the life of a famous musician this close to death is a rare thing, the film still feels like a missed opportunity. I feel like all I got from it was the reassurance that Helm was a character and that he loved what he did. And I knew both of those things going in.&lt;br /&gt;6/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/7087685332119286562/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=7087685332119286562&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/7087685332119286562" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/7087685332119286562" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/05/aint-in-it-for-my-health-2010-jacob.html" rel="alternate" title="Ain't in It for My Health (2010, Jacob Hatley)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-792740929393008608</id><published>2015-04-30T18:30:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-01T10:12:37.277-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1790s"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1803"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1992"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Classical"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Concerto"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Music"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Trumpet"></category><title type="text">Classic Trumpet Concerti of Haydn/Hummel (1992) by Gerard Schwarz, Y Chamber Symphony of New York</title><content type="html">The trumpet has always been a jazz instrument for me. I guess that's in part because I came to jazz before I came to concertos and solo pieces from the classical repertoire and because there really aren't many trumpet pieces out there. It's an under-utilized instrument, for sure. The trumpet always sounds regal or martial to me in Classical and Romantic music and I don't particularly go for that.&lt;br /&gt;Prior to 1770, the trumpet couldn't hit a wide range of notes. The keyed trumpet was invented around then and allowed for the instrument to express a greater range. The result was that composers could actually write music for it! So then we got more interesting trumpet concertos. (The modern trumpet was invented in the 1930s, so very little has been written for this particular type of trumpet.)&lt;br /&gt;Haydn's smacks to me of High Classical conventions or cliches - at least the first movement does - but there is no denying the importance, as it's the first concerto for this type of instrument. So this is basically the first time anyone ever wrote for the trumpet below the high register. And that's kind of crazy. And if I'm being fair, the trumpet really does a lot of stuff in this piece.&lt;br /&gt;The Hummel is apparently one of the few other pieces written for this particular type of trumpet (and was written for the same guy as the Haydn, the inventor of the instrument). I feel like this work is less impressive in terms of the difficulty for the trumpet, but it feels more "modern" to me musically.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is an excellent pairing of two pieces written for a unique instrument that lost the battle with history.&lt;br /&gt;9/10 </content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/792740929393008608/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=792740929393008608&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/792740929393008608" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/792740929393008608" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/04/classic-trumpet-concerti-of-haydnhummel.html" rel="alternate" title="Classic Trumpet Concerti of Haydn/Hummel (1992) by Gerard Schwarz, Y Chamber Symphony of New York" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-8865090701191552007</id><published>2015-04-30T18:00:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-05-03T19:32:55.757-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Basketball"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Draft"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="History"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="NBA"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Raptors"></category><title type="text">Raptors Best Draft Picks</title><content type="html">Earlier this season, a click-baity article was &lt;a href="http://www.tsn.ca/raptors-top-five-best-draft-picks-1.216092" target="_blank"&gt;published on TSN&lt;/a&gt; about the "best" Raptors draft picks of all time, given that this was their 20th season and all. They were, according to the author:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bosh&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mighty Mouse&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mo Pete&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DeRozan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;T Mac&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;No explanation was given for why Mo Pete is considered to be better than DeRozan or T Mac beyond the fact that he played way more games for the Raps. (Does that make him better?) There was also no explanation as to why Mighty Mouse was considered better than T Mac, beyond that the Raptors failed to retain T Mac. That really doesn't make sense. So we're going to try this again.&lt;br /&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href="https://plus.google.com/+AdamHenebury" target="_blank"&gt;Adam&lt;/a&gt; for helping with the order. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes a "best" draft pick? Well, I would argue that it's all about the knowledge the drafting organization had at the time, &lt;i&gt;however&lt;/i&gt;, this is for posterity, and about the players, not about about the organization (this post, anyway) so it's more about:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is the player going to the Hall of Fame?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If not, where does the player stand historically both in the league and, to a lesser extent, in the franchise (if applicable)? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finally, how did the player perform compared to the other players in the draft?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Whether or not that player was retained by the organization seems kind of irrelevant to me, unless we are talking about the organization's decisions, not the players' legacies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Raptors have drafted 33 players since they were formed 20 years ago. Of those players,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;7 have never played in the NBA (2 were just drafted this summer, though);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 have played less than 10 NBA games as of today (though 1 of those is Caboclo);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 more have played 20 NBA games or less as of today;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 more have played less than 100 NBA games;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A further 3 have played less than 200 NBA games (though one, Quincy Acy playe a career high minutes for the Knicks this season);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Finally, both Terrence Ross and JV have yet to play in 250 NBA games and it seems kind of unfair to decide how their careers have panned out given their respective ages. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;That leaves us with 15 players who have played 250 games or more in the NBA (i.e 3 seasons minimum). Those players are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bargs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jonathan Bender&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Bosh&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Camby&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ed Davis&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;DeMar DeRozan&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Joey Graham&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hibbert&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jamison&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;T Mac&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mo Pete&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Kareem Rush&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mighty Mouse&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;P.J. Tucker&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Charlie V&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;We should eliminate Terrence Ross from the conversation because he's too young. (Though he has played more than Jonas, he was drafted a year later.) So that leaves us with 15 players, let's rank them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have used a totally unscientific method of determining how good these guys were. You have been warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;15. Jonathan Bender, SF, drafted 5th overall, 1999&lt;/h4&gt;Drafted immediately after Lamar Odom and drafted immediately ahead of Wally Szczerbiak, Rip Hamilton, Andre Miller, Shawn Marion and Jason Terry. That list doesn't include the other NBA stars who were drafted later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1,453P, 582R, 170A in 3,847 minutes over 262 games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Per 36: 13.6P, 5.4R, 1.6A, 0.4S, 1.6P.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;.514 True Shooting %age&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10.9 PER&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;In his draft year Bender is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;26th in games played&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;27th in minutes played&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;25th in points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;29th in boards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;28th in assists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;21st in FG% (of players having played at least 200 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;12th in 3P% (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;12th in FT% (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;26th in MPG (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;23rd in PPG (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;29th in RPG (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;28th in APG (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;28th in Win Shares&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;26th in WS per 48 (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;There's no clearer "bust" on this list than Bender. Yes, his career was cut short by knee injuries, but even when he played he wasn't even close to as good as the players drafted around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How did he get away?&lt;/b&gt; A month after he was drafted, he was traded &lt;i&gt;straight up&lt;/i&gt; for Antiono Davis. So, talk about a win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;14. Kareem Rush, SG/PG, drafted 20th overall, 2002&lt;/h4&gt;Rush was drafted a few spots ahead of Tayshaun Prince and John Salmons but this was a pretty weak draft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2,213P, 353A, 150S, 572R, 74B in 5,956 minutes over 346 games; 1.7 WS, -3.2 VORP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Per 36: 13.4P, 2.1A, .9S, 3.5R, .4B&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;.482 TS %&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;9.2 PER&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&amp;nbsp;In his draft year Rush is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;23rd in games played&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;23rd in minutes played&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;23rd in points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;25th in boards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;22nd in assists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;29th in FG% (min 100 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;7th in 3P% (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;24th in FT% (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;28th in MPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;24th in PPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;37th in RPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;26th in APG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;28th in Win Shares&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;39th in WS Per 48&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;So Rush mostly almost lived up to his draft position. So he wasn't a bust. Also, his draft kind of sucked. The best players from it were Amar'e (9th), Ming (1st), Boozer (34th!!!) and Caron Butler (10th). So the Raps did good to just get a guy who played relatively close to his draft position. He didn't have much of a career though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;How did he get away?&lt;/b&gt; The day of the draft, he was traded with Tracy Murray and a 2003 2nd rounder to the Lakers for Lindsey Hunter, Chris Jeffries and a 2003 2nd rounder. Meh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;13. Joey Graham, SF, drafted 16th overall, 2005&lt;/h4&gt;Graham was drafted immediately behind Antoine Wright and, to the eternal chagrin of Raptors fans, immediately ahead of Danny Granger, as well as Gerald Green; he was also drafted ahead of Nate Robinson (21st), Jarret Jack (22nd), David Lee (30th) and some other NBA players.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2,239P, 1,058R, 207A, 134S, 43B in 6,117 minutes over 377 games; 7.8 WS; -2.8 VORP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Per 36: 13.2P, 6.2R, 1.2A, .8S, .3B&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;.551 TS %&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;11 PER&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;In his draft year Graham is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;30th in games played&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;31st in minutes played&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;30th in points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;31st in boards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;34th in assists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;12th in FG% (min 100 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;28th in 3P% (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;12th in FT% (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;34th in MPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;32nd in PPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;29th in RPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;43rd in APG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;31st in WS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;42nd in WS per 48&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;If it's possible to have a bust outside the lottery, I guess Graham was a bust. A second round player drafted ahead of a former all-star (though one who is currently struggling to stay in the league) in the middle of the first round stings a lot.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How did he get away?&lt;/b&gt; He was allowed to walk as a free agent, which was a very sensible thing for the Raptors to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;12. P. J. Tucker, SF/SG, drafted 35th overall, 2006&lt;/h4&gt;Drafted in the second round, which is a total crap shoot. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2,009P, 1,404R, 375A in 6,866 minutes over 255 games, 14 WS, 5.4 VORP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Per 36: 10.5P, 7.4R, 2A, 1.5S, 0.3B.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;.536 True Shooting %age&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;12.5 PER&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his draft year, Tucker is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;26th in games played&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;16th in minutes played&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;18th in points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;12th in boards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;17th in assists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;17th in FG% (of players to play at least 100 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;6th in 3P FG% (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;16th in FT% (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;9th in MPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10th in PPG &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4th in RPG (ahead of Bargs!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;16th in APG (better than Bargs!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;15th in Win Shares&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;13th in Win Shares Per 48 (&lt;i&gt;way&lt;/i&gt; higher than Bargs!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;It's safe to say that Tucker stands as the Best 2nd Round Pick in Raptors History, easily beating out his competition (he has played more NBA games than most of the rest of them combined). But it's fair to ask 'how do we rank that?', as Tucker left the NBA for years and has only amassed these numbers since his return. He absolutely exceeded expectations, but only after he played in Europe and Israel. Is this a better outcome than a player drafted in the first round playing to their draft position???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;How did he get away?&lt;/b&gt; He was waived in March 2007.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;11. Charlie Villanueva, PF, drafted 7th overall, 2005&lt;/h4&gt;Drafted immediately behind Martell Webster, immiedately ahead of Channing Frye and a few sports ahead of Andrew Bynum. Also drafted ahead of hte same people as Graham.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;6,489P, 2,096R, 334B, 525A, 311S in 12,913 minutes over 594 games; 22.4 WS; 1 VORP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Per 36: 18.1P, 8R, .9B, 1.5A, .9S&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;.523 TS%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;16.2 PER&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;In his draft year, Charlie V is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;13th in games played&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;18th in minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;11th in points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;12th in boards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;21st in assists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;25th in FG% (min 100 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;18th in 3P% (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;26th in FT% (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;22nd in MPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;12th in PPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;11th in RPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;33rd in APG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;19th in WS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;23rd in WS (min 100 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Not as obviously a pseudo-bust as Graham, but still fairly unsuccessful relative to the other players in his draft. The good news is that, beyond Channing Frye, nobody else immediately below Charlie V's draft spot amounted to much (now that Bynum is out of the league). So it's hard to criticize the pick too much. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How did he get away?&lt;/b&gt; Traded straight up for TJ Ford in June 2006.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;10. Ed Davis, PF/C, drafted 13th overall, 2010&lt;/h4&gt;Drafted a few spots below Paul George, immediately ahead of Patrick Patterson and Larry Sanders and a few spots ahead of Eric Bledsoe and Avery Bradley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2,552P, 2,220R, 356B, 284A, 183S in 7,563 minutes over 354 games; 22.1 WS; 5.7 VORP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Per 36: 12.1P, 10.6R, 1.7B, 1.4A, .9S&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;.568 TS%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;16.9 PER&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&amp;nbsp; In his draft year, Davis is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;7th in games played&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;13th in minutes played&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;14th in points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4th&lt;/b&gt; in boards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;17th in assists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2nd&lt;/b&gt; in FG% (min 100 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;23rd in 3P% (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;27th in FT% (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;17th in MPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;16th in PPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;5th&lt;/b&gt; in RPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;23rd in APG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;7th in WS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;6th in WS per 48&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;So far Davis is having a pretty good career relative to his draft position. His skill set is slowly becoming outmoded in the current NBA (though that could change) but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zachlowe_nba/status/489601601162973184" target="_blank"&gt;Zach Lowe thinks he is a more than serviceable NBA player&lt;/a&gt;. Who knows, maybe a better team will eventually use him well. Still sort of sad we got rid of him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How did he get away?&lt;/b&gt; Traded with Jose Calderon and a 2013 2nd round pick to the Grizzlies while the Pistions traded Austin Daye and Tayshaun Prince to the Grizzlies; in return the Grizzlies traded Calderon to the Pistons and Rudy Gay and Hamed Haddadi to the Raptors. All on January 30, 2013.&amp;nbsp; I know we had to move Jose, but I still don't really like this. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;9. Andrea Bargnani, PF/C, drafted 1st overall, 2006&lt;/h4&gt;Drafted  immediately ahead of LMAD, Adam Morrison, Tyrus Thomas, Shelden Williams  and Brandon Roy. Also ahead of Gay (8th), JJ Redick (10th), Rondo  (21st), Lowry (24th), Paul Millsap (47th) and, of course, PJ Tucker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;7,569P, 2,444R, 461B, 635A, 203S in 15,172 minutes over 504 games; 18.7 WS; .1 VORP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Per 36: 18P, 5.8R, 1.1B, 1.5A, .5S&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;.532 TS%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;14.5 PER&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;In his draft year, Bargnani is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;9th in games played&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;7th in minutes played&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4th&lt;/b&gt; in points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;5th&lt;/b&gt; in boards (behind Rondo!!!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;14th in assists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;20th in FG% (min 100 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;7th 3P% (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;5th&lt;/b&gt; in FT% (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;5th&lt;/b&gt; in MPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4th&lt;/b&gt; in PPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;6th in RPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;19th in APG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;11th in WS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;32nd in WS per 48 (27th if we cut it off at 100 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Of all the 7 footers to play 500 games or more in the NBA (62 of them), Bargs is somehow 53rd in RPG. That is incredible. And says everything you need to know about him.&lt;br /&gt;So,  I'm sure you're wondering why I don't think he was a bust. Why I could  suggest that only Bender and, perhaps, Graham, were busts. Well, for a  couple of reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Despite are hatred of Bargs, he still  managed to be a top 5 player in his draft year in terms of many  categories and I don't think you can call that a bust - the draft sucked  donkey balls;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Look at &lt;a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_2006.html" target="_blank"&gt;who came immediately after him&lt;/a&gt;: LMAD was the only other player still in the league among the top 6 until Tyrus Thomas made a come back this season;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In  hindsight LMAD was the right choice and Roy would have been an  excellent choice too, despite his injury problems (if only becuse he was  still way better than the 3 players between him and LMAD);&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I  think, relatively speaking, Morrison is a worse pick, as was Thomas  (maybe not Williams given where he went) - Bargs would have been a  pretty solid pick at 3 or 4 and you shouldn't be able to say that about  busts;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Also, lots of people thought he was the next Dirk (though far from everyone).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;So  yeah, Bargs sucks. Good riddance. So glad the Knicks are the Knicks.  But I really think his status as bust has been exagerrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How did he get away?&lt;/b&gt; (Or, rather, how did we get free of him?) Traded to the Knicks for Marcus Camby (bought out), Steve Novak, Quentin Richardson (waived), a 2014 2nd rounder, a 2016 1st rounder and a 2017 2nd rounder in one of the greatest transactions in recent franchise history, on July 10, 2013. That was a happy, happy day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;8. Morris Peterson, SF/SG, drafted 21st overall, 2000&lt;/h4&gt;Drafted immiedately after Speedy Claxton and two spots ahead of DeShawn Stevenson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;7,628P, 2,483R, 1,090A, 639S, 136B in 19,366 minutes over 711 games; 35.7 WS; 9.7 VORP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Per 36: 14.2P, 4.6R, 2A, 1.2S, .3B&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;.529 TS%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;13.3 PER&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;In his draft year, Mo Pete is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;9th in games played&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;8th in minutes played&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;8th in points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10th in boards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;12th in assists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;23rd in FG% (min 100 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5th in 3P% (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;11th in FT% (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;6th in MPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;7th in PPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;19th in RPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;18th in APG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;6th in Win Shares&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;12th in WS per 48 (min 100 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mo Pete is the all-time leader in games played for the franchise and he's certainly beloved, but in no way does that make him the third best draft pick in Raptors history. What a claim like that says is that it matters whether or not (or when) the player is traded, which has nothing to do with the player, most of the time. So I find that kind of reasoning confusing (in addition to being wrong).&lt;br /&gt;Sure he did extremely well compared to his draft position, but &lt;a href="http://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_2000.html" target="_blank"&gt;it was a terrible draft&lt;/a&gt;; the best players were Michael Redd, &lt;i&gt;Hedo Turkoglu&lt;/i&gt;, Mike Miller and Kenyon Martin. It was &lt;a href="http://insider.espn.go.com/nba/insider/story/_/id/10714672/nba-2013-14-rookie-class-worst-ever" target="_blank"&gt;probably the worst draft in history&lt;/a&gt;. So it's amazing the Raps got an NBA player, let alone one who eventually played over 700 games. But that doesn't make Mo Pete the third greatest draft pick in Raptors history. It just means he did way better than he should of (as did the team), all other things being equal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;How did he get away?&lt;/b&gt; Allowed to walk as a free agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;7. Roy Hibbert, C, drafted 17th overall, 2008&lt;/h4&gt;Drafted immediately  after Marreese Speights, immediately ahead of Javale McGee and JJ  Hickson, and a few spots ahead of Ryan Anderson. Also drafted ahead of  Serge Ibaka, George Hill, Nikola Pekovic, Omer Asik and Goran Dragic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;5,909P, 3,623R, 990B, 769A, 201S in 13,829 minutes over 533 games; 31.9 WS; 8.6 VORP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Per 36: 15.4P, 9.4R, 2.6B, 2A, .5S&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;.511 TS%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;16.2 PER&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2 All Star Game appearances&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 All Defensive 2nd Team &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;In his draft year, Hibbert is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2nd&lt;/b&gt; in games played&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;8th in minutes played&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;8th in points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4th&lt;/b&gt; in boards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;13th in assists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;17th in FG% (min 100 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;25th in 3P% (min 100 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;24th in FT% (ditto)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;16th in MPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;15th in PPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;9th in RPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;17th in APG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10th in WS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;18th in WS per 48&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Not too long ago, Hibbert might have placed above DeRozan on  this list. How things have changed. He was still an excellent choice in  his spot as Ibaka was drated 7 places below him and it seems  unreasonable to me to think the Raps would have dreamed of taking him  that high.&lt;br /&gt;It's a shame the Raps traded him away immediately, in a trade that will live in infamy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To the Pacers: Maceo Baston, TJ Ford, Hibbert &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; Rasho&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To the Raps: Nathan "The Australian Shaq" Jawai and Jermaine O'Neal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;b&gt;How did he get away?&lt;/b&gt; See the above disaster, about two weeks after the draft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;6. DeMar DeRozan, SG, drafted 9th overall, 2009&lt;/h4&gt;DeRozan was drafted immiedately behind Jordan Hill (YES!!!), immediately ahead of Brandon Jennings, and a few spots ahead of Gerald Henderson and Tyler Hansbrough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;7,606P, 1,056A, 411S, 1,689R, 129B in 14,851 minutes over 443 games; 25.5 WS; 1.2 VORP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Per 36: 18.4P, 2.6A, 1S, 4.1R, .3B&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;.524 TS% &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;15.3 PER&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1 All Star Game appearance &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;In his draft year, DeRozan is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;2nd&lt;/b&gt; in games played&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;1st&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt; in minutes played&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4th&lt;/b&gt; in points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;9th in boards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;11th in assists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;20th in FG% (minimum 100 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;35th in 3P% (ditto) &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;11th in FT% (minimum 100 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4th&lt;/b&gt; in MPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;4th&lt;/b&gt; in PPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;14th in RPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;15th in APG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;9th in WS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;26th in WS per 48&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;It's hard to know where DeRozan will end up on this overall list until he plays a lot more games but so far he appears to have been a really, really good choice at the 9th spot. He still struggles with his efficiency and he lacks an outside shot, but otherwise I think Raptors fans have to remain happy with the choice that was made (for once!); it's not DeRozan's fault that the Raps have failed to acquire a bigger star.&lt;br /&gt;So really his spot on this list is TBD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.ca/2015/05/the-top-5-raptors-draft-picks-of-all.html" target="_blank"&gt;See the Top 5&lt;/a&gt;</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/8865090701191552007/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=8865090701191552007&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/8865090701191552007" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/8865090701191552007" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/04/raptors-best-draft-picks.html" rel="alternate" title="Raptors Best Draft Picks" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-2951301801353642623</id><published>2015-04-30T17:30:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-04-30T17:30:01.605-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2015"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Documentary"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Hot Docs"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Palestine"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Racing"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Women"></category><title type="text">Speed Sisters (2015, Amber Fares)</title><content type="html">This is an entertaining and captivating documentary about the Palestinian women's car racing team, who supply their own cars, who race against men (and each other) and who practice in empty parkling lots and on local streets. Racing in Palestine is (I believe) unlike anything else in the world, as the races have to be designed for the circumstances, so it's all about turning around cones and going the correct direction (without signs to tell you which way that is, so the driver has to memorize the route) on an open paved area. The film catpures what is like to be a female race car driver in an Arab-Islamic society, and one that also happens to be occupied by Israel. There's a lot going on here, and it's a testament to the filmmaker (this is her first feature!!!) that she is able to balance everything most of the time.&lt;br /&gt;The film has some pacing issues and doesn't even get to the race that it initially sets us up for (and I have no idea why) but otherwise, this is a great insight into life in another culture and country, a side of Palestine we never see on the news, and a film that manages to make you feel good about people and where we're at in the world.&lt;br /&gt;8/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/2951301801353642623/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=2951301801353642623&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/2951301801353642623" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/2951301801353642623" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/04/speed-sisters-2015-amber-fares.html" rel="alternate" title="Speed Sisters (2015, Amber Fares)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-2999448213164469122</id><published>2015-04-30T17:00:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-04-30T17:00:03.627-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2015"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Hot Docs"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Movies"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Quebec"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Racing"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Short Film"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sports"></category><title type="text">Hell Runs on Gasoline (2015, Martin Bureau)</title><content type="html">This is an extraordinary 7 minute film about something I was utterly unaware of: the absolutely insane, free-for-all racing in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint-F%C3%A9licien,_Quebec" target="_blank"&gt;Saint-Felicien, Quebec&lt;/a&gt;.

(However, there appears to be some debate.) The sonatas are Nos. 39, 40, 41, 48, 49 and 51, which seems an arbitrary selection. However, the alernative cataloguing of Haydn's works (really, the standard catalogue) suggests that all but 49 were composed during two particular moments, so maybe that's why. (Okay, I'll stop.)&lt;br /&gt;The 39th is a gorgeous piece of music. Very, very Classical, but still interesting enough (and clearly difficult) that it isn't just a simple melody.&lt;br /&gt;The 40th is really whacky and out there, for it's time anyway. I love this kind of thing where it skirts along, threatening to break rules but never quite breaking them. In the showy parts you almost, &lt;i&gt;almost&lt;/i&gt; lose the melody. Really great.&lt;br /&gt;The 41st starts off sounding really traditional but there are still lots of moments for the player to show off.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This one is pretty playful actually. I like it.&lt;br /&gt;The 48th is very jaunty in the style you would really associate with this era. However, again Haydn shows that he's not just any old composer. He varies the left hand from phrase to phrase, and that's before the piece really takes off about a minute in. Good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;The 49th is rather dark compared to the others in this collection, but that's because of the key, obviously. It's still not Romantic dark, but it's borderline (which reminds me of a number of his late symphonies). It might be my least favourite of the group, though. Just a little too straightforward.&lt;br /&gt;The 51st appears to be the most famous here as it is the only one with a wikpedia entry. It constantly shifts tempos and seems to jump all over the place.&amp;nbsp; Though a couple parts are hummable most of it shows off the player's ability. You often think it's about to head to cliche/convention, but then it does not. I can see why it's famous.&lt;br /&gt;I guess the collection is a little bit arbitrary but it's tough to curate these down to a single disc anyway, as there are 60 ish of these.

A weeks later &lt;a href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.ca/2014/05/your-2013-14-toronto-raptors.html" target="_blank"&gt;I concluded last year's edition ranked among the best&lt;/a&gt;. But at the beginning of this calendar year, &lt;a href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.ca/2015/01/2014-was-year-of-raptor.html" target="_blank"&gt;I was optimistic that we were seeing the best team in the history of the franchise&lt;/a&gt;. And now that team has been swept in the most embarassing way imaginable, with the final game looking like a no-contest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This team still set the record for most wins in a regular season (49), highest winning percentage in the regular season (.598) and won the team's third division title (an utterly meaningless thing, especially in the Altantic). However, this is a team that was winning nearly 80% of its games in the fall and was on pace for 60 wins at one point. Yeah, we should have expected a regression, but this bad a regression? The Raptors were 15-5 in their first 20 games. As of Christmas day they were 22-7. &lt;b&gt;22-7!!!&lt;/b&gt; They finished the regular season 49-33 and the finished with a 49-47 overall record thanks to The Sweep. That's a massive, massive swing in the wrong direction. (Last year's team managed 51-38 if you include the playoffs.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I know there was no plan for a Lowry-DeRozan playoff team post Rudy Gay. I understand that this was a ll a lucky fluke, that the Raps were back to making the playoffs when they were supposed to be tearing it down. But that doesn't make this sting less. So, for a record setting year, this will be a rather sad summary, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(As usual, players are ranked by minutes played. Ages are as of February 1, 2015.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Kyle Lowry, 28, PG:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;34.5 MPG; Per 36: 18.6P, 7.1A, 1.6S, 4.9R, .2B; 19.3 PER; .527 TS% in 70 games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career Per 36: 15.2P, 6.8A, 1.6S, 4.8R, .3B; 17.3 Career PER; .546 Career TS%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;$12 mil per season until 2017 with a player option for 2018&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acquired by Bryan Colangelo for Gary Forbes and a 2013 first round pick (Steven Adams)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Lowry got off to a hot start and got his all-star game appearance that many people though he deserved the season prior, and he carried the team when DeRozan went down. Unfortunately Lowry was clearly warn out by the end of the season and possibly injured. Also, lacking his co-star, he started playing a lot more selfishly. Those two things resulted in this ugly performance during The Sweep:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;32.8 MPG;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Per 36: 13.5, 5.2A, 1.4S, 5.5R, 0B with 4.5 fouls and 3 Turnovers&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;7.9 PER; .396 TS%; -.3 WS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Lowry will be "basketball old" by the end of his current contract and it's worth thinking about a post-Lowry Raptors team for that very reason and also because it seems pretty obvious that the Raptors cannot even be an okay playoff team with Lowry as their best or 2nd best player. I love Lowry, but it's probably for the best that this team got killed. Had they killed the Wizards and given a second round opponent some grief, we might have all been thinking we had something.&lt;br /&gt;(Please note, however, that if this becomes a Casey vs. Lowry decision - based on some rumours I am hearing this week - I am firmly on Lowry's side at the moment. I was not impressed by Casey during The Sweep. Not at all.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Patrick Patterson, 25, PF:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;26.6 MPG; Per 36: 10.8P, 7.2R, .7B, 2.6A, 1S; 14.6 PER; .568 TS% in 81 games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career Per 36: 12.7P, 7.4R, .9B, 1.9A, .9S; 14.4 Career PER; .538 Career TS%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;About $6 per season until 2017&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acquired by Masai Ujiri with Chuck Hayes, John Salmons, and Greivis Vasquez for Rudy Gay, Quincy Acy and Aaron Gray on December 9, 2013&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;It's a miracle that a team with Patterson as it's second most important player won 49 games. That's not meant to be a slight on 2Pat. It's more meant to raise awareness about how this team was hampered by injuries and, perhaps, by bizarre lineups. 2Pat is the Raps' stretch 4 and that's a common thing these days, but there's no way he's the team's second best player, as was reflected in the playoffs, when the team was healthier and Patterson tied for 6th in total minutes. Patterson scored as much as could be expected during The Sweep, but got beaten up on the boards by the Wiz.&lt;br /&gt;2Pat is a fine complimentary player but that's all. Likely a 7th man or perhaps even farther down the depth chart on a good team.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;DeMar DeRozan, 25, SG:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;35 MPG; Per 36: 20.6P, 3.6A, 1.3S, 4.7R, .2B; 17.4 PER; .510 TS% in 60 games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career Per 36: 18.4P, 2.6A, 1S, 4.1R, .3B; 15.3 Career PER; .524 Career TS%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;$9.5 mil per season until 2016 with a player option for 2017&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drafted by Bryan Colangelo 9th overall in 2009&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;DeRozan's year was obviously deeply affected by his injury and he saw a bit of dip in his scoring as well as a significant dip in his efficiency. And like Lowry, he didn't have a good playoff (though it was hardly as bad as Lowry's). Given his age, his salary and his skill level, DeRozan is a much better bet to stick around past any rejigging of the team than Lowry, but I personally don't ever see DeRozan being more than the 2nd or 3rd option on a great team. And I have no idea how that would ever happen. But I guess he remains the future until we can find something better.&lt;br /&gt;Just as an aside: DeRozan has turned out rather well compared to the rest of his draft class. He is&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2nd in games played&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1st in minutes played&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4th in points&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;9th in boards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;11th in assists&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;9th in FG% (minimum 400 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;6th in FT% (minimum 400 games)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4th in MPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4th in PPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;14th in RPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;15th in APG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;9th in WS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;And remember, he was drafted 9th. So we did well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Jonas Valanciunas, 22, C:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;26.2 MPG; Per 36: 16.5P, 11.9R, 1.6B, .7A, .6S; 20.6 PER; .623 TS% in 80 games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career Per 36: 14.9P, 10.9R, 1.5B, .9A, .5S, 17.6 Career PER;&amp;nbsp; .605 Career TS%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rookie deal until 2016&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drafted by Bryan Colangelo 5th overall in 2011&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Despite getting played a lot less, JV had a career year offensively, in terms of both overall and efficiency. And certainly Casey's handling of him has to be one of the main reasons (in addition to The Sweep) that Ujiri has to think seriously about either getting rid of Casey or trying to move JV for something else. Casey seems terrified to use him late in the game and that's frustrating because JV is still only 22 and big man defence takes a long time to learn in the NBA. Offensively, he's getting close to where I think a lot of people were hoping he'd be, when Casey lets him play. I know this team was trying to win games, but it would be nice if they could also try to develop their supposed centre of the future.&lt;br /&gt;So there's a big choice coming up. Are they patient and hope that eventually learns NBA defence or do they try to move him for someone more polished ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Terrence Ross, 23, SF/SG:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;25.5 MPG; Per 36: 13.9P, 3.9R, 1.5A, .9S, .4B; 11.2 PER; .519 TS% in 82 games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career Per 36: 14.1P, 4.1R, 1.4A, 1S, .4B; 11.3 Career PER; .526 Career TS%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rookie Deal ending in 2016&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drafted by Bryan Colangelo 8th overall in 2012&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Ross had his sophomore slump in his third season, seeing a regression both in his scoring and his efficiency. He also appeared (to me) to be more inconsistent on defence. 3 years in, Ross isn't a bust but a lot of us wondered why he started 61 games when there was a better bigger player capable of playing his position. And his inability to excel consistently at the either end suggests the idea that if there is another team out there who looks at him and sees potential maybe he should be moved. It's hard to see him as a major piece going forward anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Lou Williams, 28, SG/PG:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;25.2 MPG; Per 36: 22.2P, 2.9A, 1.6S, 2.7R, .2B; 19.9 PER; .564 TS% in 80 games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career Per 36: 18.8P, 4.6A, 1.4S, 3.1R, .3B; 17.5 Career PER; .540 Career TS%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UFA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acquired by Masai Ujiri with Lucas Nogueira for the corpse of John Salmons&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Williams won the 6th Man of the Year award for his career (by PP36) or near-career (by PER) year this season. However the "Give Lou the ball to bail us out" strategy failed utterly in the playoffs when his True Shooting %age dropped &lt;i&gt;130 points&lt;/i&gt;. Williams is one of those players who is great when he's hitting and not of much use when he's not (though he was better defensively than I was expecting). Williams is probably getting paid because of his award and I for one don't think the Raptors should be the team to pay him, if only because we know what he is and 6th Man of the Year will probably be his career peak. Can Ujiri sign him for the hometown discount and trade him to someone who needs bench offense?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Greivis Vasquez, 29, PG:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;24.3 MPG; Per 36: 14P, 5.5A, .8S, 3.9R, .2B; 12.6 PER; .514 TS% in 82 games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career Per 36: 13.8P, 7.3A, .9S, 3.9R, .1B; 14 Career PER; .513 Career TS%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;$6.6 mil until 2016&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acquired by Masai Ujiri with Chuck Hayes, Patrick Patterson and John Salmons for Quincy Acy, Rudy Gay and Aaron Gray&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Last year the Lowry-Vasquez double point guard lineup killed the Eastern Conference. For some reason it didn't work as well this year. For one thing Vasquez saw his shooting percentages drop back down towards his career numbers. Also, Vasquez is too slow to guard his position a lot of the time, but we knew that already. Otherwise, I don't really know what happened -&amp;nbsp; maybe it was the arrival of Lou Williams. Anyway his regular season was only marginally worse than last year; it was the playoffs where he really struggled (with the exception of a few huge shots early in the series).&lt;br /&gt;Vasquez is one of the oldest players on the team. It's unlikely he's part of the long-term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Amir Johnson, 27, PF/C:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;26.4 MPG; Per 36: 12.6P, 8.3R, 1.1B, 2.1A, .8S; 15.4 PER; .603 TS% in 75 games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career Per 36: 12.2P, 9.1R, 1.7B, 1.7A, 1S; 16.1 Career PER; .603 Career TS%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UFA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acquired by Bryan Colangelo with Sonny Weems for Carlos Delfino and Roko Ukic&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Amir remains the Raptors' best interior defender but he's struggling with injuries and though he's fouling less, he still fouls an awful lot. Unlike the rest of the team he actually did alright in the playoffs.&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what to do here. I figured Amir is going to have more and more ankle issues as he ages. On the other hand, without him, the Raps are really, really weak when it comes to defensive bigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;James Johnson, 27, SF/PF:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Per 36: 14.6P, 6.8R, 2.5A, 1.4S, 1.8B; 17.9 PER; .617 TS% in 70 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career Per 36: 13.1P, 6.4R, 3A, 1.5S, 1.9B; 14.5 Career PER; .528 Career TS% &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;$2.5 mil until 2016&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Signed by Masai Ujiri on July 15, 2014&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Despite having one of the best years of his career, Johnson inexplicably started 17 games to Ross' 61. Now, it's not the starts that matter, it's the finishes. Casey played Ross for over 700 minutes more. Was this some attempt to see what they had in Ross? To let him grow up? I don't know. Johnson is a much more mature player than he was the first time around in Toronto. Yes, he still makes boneheaded decisions on offence, but he is the team's best wing defender. And he doesn't make as many boneheaded decisions as he used to. He played a total of 12 minutes during The Sweep and I have no idea why. No idea.(I know he missed four consecutive free throws, but the Raptors basically didn't play defense and he would have helped that.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Tyler Hansbrough, 29, PF:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Per 36: 9.2P, 9R, .5B, .7A, 1.S; 13.3 PER; .597 TS% in 74 games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career Per 36: 14.5P, 9R, .4B, .9A, 1S; 14.9 Career PER; .525 Career TS%&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UFA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Signed by Masai Ujiri on July 15, 2013&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;I would be surprised if Hansbrough is retained this summer. He's done a decent job of fulfilling his role on the Raps but players of his skill set are slowly becoming less and less useful in the modern NBA, I think. (Though there're always reasons to buck a trend.) If he does come back, he'd likely be cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's everone who played 1000 minutes in the regular season this year. Hell, that's everyone who played 500 minutes. &lt;i&gt;300&lt;/i&gt; minutes. The Raps had a deep bench up to a point. Of the remaining players:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chuck Hayes is an UFA and the oldest player on the team - he will not be back;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The organization is finally out from under the terrible Landry Fields contract this summer - I will be amazed if he isn't playing in Europe or China next season;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gret Stiemsa was a warm body on the veteran's minimum - another may take his place;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have no idea what to think about Lucas Nogueira but at least we got him for free practically;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I remain very skeptical about Bruno Caboclo but I also know zero about basketball player development - if this was hockey I would be demanding he start every game in the D League.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Raptors are at a crossroads: is losing in a game 7 in the first round the peak potential of a Lowry-DeRozan core? I didn't feel that way three weeks ago. I sure do now. (Let me be clear: I didn't think the Raps would make it past the second round, but I at least hoped they would win some games and maybe make it &lt;i&gt;to&lt;/i&gt; the second round.)&lt;br /&gt;I for one support a change of direction at this point. I am okay with moving on from this group. Unless, with the new cap situation in a year or so, the Raps can attract or acquire a player or two clearly better than DeRozan (and who plays a complimentary position, as opposed to who plays essentially the same game as him cough Rudy Gay cough) then I think it's okay to stick with these guys for a few more years. But if Lowry and DeRozan remain the best players on this team, I think first round exits are our future until 2018, and I don't look forward to that. So I am perfectly comfortable with the idea that no one on this roster is untouchable. So hopefully things improve. I still have some faith in Ujiri at this point, especially given that he didn't make a move at the trade deadilne. So I am optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;And now I will go back to crying myself to sleep.

Grumble.&lt;br /&gt;Haydn's first cello concerto is a fine piece of music but it strikes me as typical of the era (though I don't really know that). Though the cello is perhaps my favourite orchestral instrument I can't help but compare this work to what came before - specially Bach's cello music, which is probably the best ever written (or at least very close to that). This is fine, really, and it certainly has a number of beautiful passages for the instrument, but it's a little too classically Classical (see what I did there?) for me. This is apparently the first cello concerto ever. So I should really just get over myself.&lt;br /&gt;The Pereira "Concertino" is very pleasant albeit traditional. The composer apparently tried to combine some tradtional Brazilian folk melodies with at least some baroque influences that the Portuguese would have brought to Brazil when they were colonizing it. I don't know enough about Brazillian music to know if the folk part is true, but this is certainly a Neo Baroque attitude, not Baroque. (To be fair, he calls it "Quasi Baroque" which still seems to me quite a stretch.) The second movement is gorgeous. The third reminds me of a melody from a film soundtrack. I have no idea why it's included here.&lt;br /&gt;The second cello concerto was once thought to be the only surviving one. (At one point, &lt;i&gt;five&lt;/i&gt; cello concerti were attributed to Haydn; it's down to three and one is lost.) This is a lot more laidback than the first, which gives it an entirely different aura than the earlier work. It is, at times, significantly different in tone than I would have expected from a work of its era. So, at least initially, I like it more. For example, the first movement has a pretty crazy solo passage.&lt;br /&gt;It's an odd collection; the Haydn music is pretty essential but it's so odd that they couldn't find something more appropriate to pair with it than a moder work composed in the 21st century. An odd choice.&lt;br /&gt;7/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/7359870065971575822/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=7359870065971575822&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/7359870065971575822" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/7359870065971575822" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/04/haydn-cello-concertos-pereira.html" rel="alternate" title="Haydn: Cello Concertos; Pereira: Concertino for Cello (2010) by Antonio Meneses, Northern Sinfonia" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-5025626102013630858</id><published>2015-04-28T17:00:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-04-28T17:00:01.648-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Documentary"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Foreign Policy"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Hot Docs"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Intelligence Failures"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Iraq War"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Movies"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="War"></category><title type="text">War of Lies (2014, Mathias Bittner)</title><content type="html">Let's get this out of the way: This is a student film. The director freely admitted last night that he made this as his graduation "project" for film school.&amp;nbsp; When he said that &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; the movie, my expectations lowered considerably. I am always wary of first time directors.&lt;br /&gt;And there are definitely signs that this is a first freature: too much use of the static between TV clips, which is such a cliche; awkward pacing; unnecessary scenes; etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;But&lt;/i&gt;...and it's a big 'but': This is one compelling film. Here we have an interview with one of the couple major sources for the US's bogus intelligence for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. This is the guy who claimed that there were mobile chemical weapons factories. This interview is about why he said what he said and how he feels about it now. The film is just the interview, plus Bittner's attempts at drametizing Aljanabi's state of mind - I worried those attempts would be awkard but, for the most part, they work really well as a means of placing the viewer inside his mental state (provided, of course, Aljanabi is telling the truth, and we have no reason to believe he is). I don't think I have ever seen a film like this - one subject telling his side of a story with the film set out to show how he felt. It's like one of those TV shows about near-death experiences but with only one interviewee, no narrators, and it's way, way better.&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of whether or not Aljanabi is telling the truth, the film is a damning indictment of both the German Federal Intelligence Service and the CIA, and anyone else who believed this nonsense (MI6 for example). It's a perfect example of how human beings hear what they want to hear. At this point hundreds of thousands (I recently heard "one million or more") people died in part because the Federal Intelligence Service decided Aljanabi was credible. If that doesn't make you angry, nothing will.&lt;br /&gt;An absolute must see despite the odd technical issue.&lt;br /&gt;9/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/5025626102013630858/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=5025626102013630858&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/5025626102013630858" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/5025626102013630858" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/04/war-of-lies-2014-mathias-bittner.html" rel="alternate" title="War of Lies (2014, Mathias Bittner)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-547054692765681829</id><published>2015-04-27T18:00:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-04-27T18:00:00.824-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1790s"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2010"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Classical"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Music"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Symphony"></category><title type="text">Haydn: London Symphonies (2010) by Les Musiciens du Louvre conducted by Marc Minkowski</title><content type="html">This is an excellent collection of Haydn's final symphonies, the "London symphonies".&lt;br /&gt;The first (93rd overall) begins with a downright Romantic movement and that first movement plays around with tonality a little bit more than the average classical symphony. A later movement plays with the theme. Very interesting. One of the better of the bunch. It's worth noting that he didn't write it first.&lt;br /&gt;The second (94th overall) starts off very conventionally. But there's a reason it's known as the "Surprise" symphony, and that reason has got to be one of the most shocking moments in the Classical era, perhaps in Western Art Music up until it was written (1792). Now, I tend to make a rather big deal about daring individual moments, perhaps more so than I should. But I can't help myself here, as it's unlike anything that ever occurred before in the tradition (to my limited knowledge). I guess the criticism of this is that it's just one moment, and maybe the symphony as a whole isn't all that great. But I can't separate the moment - a moment of utter daring but, at the same time, a sense of humour so rare (at least in much of the 20th century) in the stuffy traditionalism of the classical tradition. There's a little bit of a hint it's coming. At about 35 seconds into the movement there's a brief pause that really shocks you. But at 50 seconds or so is when the crazy chord comes out of nowhere. And even today it shocks audiences. It sounds like an idea out of modernism. But here it is in a symphony written in 1792. My mind has been blown.&lt;br /&gt;The third (95th) is, because of its minor key, a little more downbeat in tone than the rest. It is one of his symphonies that seems to me to almost suggest Romantic music. Like so many of his symphonies, it has little unconventional tricks. It's one of the best here, in my mind. &lt;br /&gt;The fourth (96th) was actually written first and I feel like you can tell. It has some neat flourishes and the like but is possibly the least interesting of the twelve symphonies.&lt;br /&gt;The fifth (97th) is one of the most conventional of these late symphonies. The second and third movements both have neat little tricks in them, but on the whole the work isn't quite as bold as some of the others in this series. &lt;br /&gt;The sixth (98th) has another one of these really dark openings that Haydn seemed so fond of at the time (see the 93rd and the "London"). It's a relatively radical symphony for him, even at this late date (though like many of his more innovative works, it's hard for us lay people to pick up on all the innovations). It's pretty solid.&lt;br /&gt;The seventh (99th) begins with a very different opening (to my ears) to most of the other symphonies in this set. It is striking in its tempo and apparently also in its tonality (though I have a hard time hearing that). It's a pretty interesting work and I think it's kind of easy to tell that this was written on his second trip, i.e. a couple years after many of the symphonies in this set were written. It seems more mature to me.&lt;br /&gt;The eighth (100th) or "Military" sure doesn't sound martial at first. The opening movement is about as typically "classical" as I could imagine a symphony, I think. The second has a lot of cymbals, so I guess that's what makes it sound "military". There's certainly more percussion in this movement than I can recall in any other of Haydn's. But it doesn't really make a huge impression on me, despite that apparent novelty.&lt;br /&gt;I have heard the "Clock" symphony (the 9th of these) before. I continue to like it.&lt;br /&gt;The tenth (102nd) is yet another of these symphonies with a kind of moody, proto-Romantic opening. It's also the second of these (if memory serves) that opens slowly, a relatively unique thing at the time, I believe. But of the later London symphonies, it is certainly one of the least interesting.&lt;br /&gt;The eleventh (103rd) starts off about as whacky as any classical symphony I've heard with timpani, hence it's nickname "Drumroll". Following the drum roll, the opening notes remind me of a Romanic piece of music I can't quite place. Both effects are rather daring (though it's likely the Romantic piece I'm thinking of was inspired by this symphony). It's also super slow to start out, though it picks up in pace. To me it's certainly more affecting than many of his others, and I love that opening.&lt;br /&gt;I have heard the "London" before; it's one of his best.&lt;br /&gt;This kind of collection is the best way to hear the works of the past, in my mind. And this series propably represents not only the height of Haydn's symphonic work, but the best classical symphonies out of Mozart (that's me talking out of my ass). Great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;10/10 </content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/547054692765681829/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=547054692765681829&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/547054692765681829" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/547054692765681829" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/04/haydn-london-symphonies-2010-by-les.html" rel="alternate" title="Haydn: London Symphonies (2010) by Les Musiciens du Louvre conducted by Marc Minkowski" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-8429948261984515832</id><published>2015-04-27T17:53:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-04-27T17:53:00.220-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2014"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2015"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Campaign to Fire Dave Nonis"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Hockey"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Maple Leafs"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="NHL"></category><title type="text">Your 2014-15 Toronto Maple Leafs</title><content type="html">[So I accidentally published this before I was done. Um, oops. This is now the complete version.]&lt;br /&gt;I watched as little of the Leafs this year as I have since I was 16, more than half my life ago. I did this becuse &lt;a href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.ca/p/the-campaign-to-fire-brian-burke.html" target="_blank"&gt;Burke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.ca/search/label/Campaign%20to%20Fire%20Dave%20Nonis" target="_blank"&gt;then Nonis&lt;/a&gt; killed my passion for the team after JFJ made me &lt;i&gt;more&lt;/i&gt; passionate (albeit passionate as to wanting him fired). I'm sort of kidding. I was still passionate enough about the Leafs that in late 2013 I began writing &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00KUQHWM8" target="_blank"&gt;a book to summarise my great dislike of Burke's handling of the Leafs&lt;/a&gt; and that book was published last summer, not long after most people decided that Nonis was terrible. I strongly agree that Nonis was a terrible GM (and he makes Burke look good in comparison) but we should remember that Nonis got all his NHL executive work because of Burke, and that Burke is the one who created the team Nonis couldn't fix and the climate in which Nonis proceeded to fail so miserably. Both are responsible. I guess that's the bad news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Not to toot my own (goal) horn (okay, to toot it just a little), but I knew that  this was going to happen. In my book I argued there was no way a  Kessel-Phaneuf nucleus was taking the Leafs to the Cup. &lt;a href="http://i%20guess%20that%27s%20the%20bad%20news./" target="_blank"&gt;Back in March of 2011 I tried to bet one of you that it wouldn't happen. I offered beer&lt;/a&gt;. But I thought it was going to take a lot longer than this for everyone else to catch up to me. (I'm soooo smart after all.) So the good news is that Nonis has been fired and so have a ton of other personnel who are believed to have contributed to all those past bad decisions - drafting poorly (at least in terms of Canadians), terrible free agent signings, cap mismanagement, and the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so, with that good news in mind, I present a completely uninformed guess as to where the Leafs should go from here, now that they are finally out from under Burke's idiotic "rebuild on the fly" project and can actually think of properly rebuilding post-Mats Sundin. The core component of that rebuild might of might not be this summer's #4 overall pick (as that spot's not quite guaranteed to produce a star) - &lt;a href="http://www.hockey-reference.com/players/t/thornsc01.html" target="_blank"&gt;the first pick that high for the Leafs &lt;i&gt;since 1989&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - but in the meantime let's focus on the team at hand and think about whether any of them should stick around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(As always with these wrap ups, the players are ranked in terms of time on ice. &lt;b&gt;Age is their age as of February 1st&lt;/b&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Jonathan Bernier, 26, G:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;21-28-7, 2 SO, .912 SV%, 2.87 GAA, 26 quality starts (QS), 11 really bad starts (RBS) in 58 games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career: 76-67-20, 9 SO, .916 SV%, 2.64 GAA, 87 QS, 24 RBS in 175 games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RFA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acquired by Dave Nonis for Matt Frattin, Ben Scrivens and a &lt;a href="http://www.prosportstransactions.com/hockey/Search/SearchResults.php?Player=scrivens&amp;amp;Team=&amp;amp;BeginDate=&amp;amp;EndDate=&amp;amp;PlayerMovementChkBx=yes&amp;amp;submit=Search" target="_blank"&gt;second round pick (unknown)&lt;/a&gt; on June 23, 2013&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Bernier had a below average year for him but we should note not particularly below average. Bernier's 2013-14 season was the best of his career and the only one in which he was even a 1A. The sample for Bernier is rather small compared to some other goaltenders his age; &lt;a href="http://www.hockey-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;amp;match=combined&amp;amp;year_min=2008&amp;amp;year_max=2015&amp;amp;season_start=1&amp;amp;season_end=-1&amp;amp;rookie=N&amp;amp;age_min=0&amp;amp;age_max=26&amp;amp;birth_country=&amp;amp;franch_id=&amp;amp;is_active=&amp;amp;is_hof=&amp;amp;pos=G&amp;amp;handed=&amp;amp;c1stat=games_goalie&amp;amp;c1comp=gt&amp;amp;c1val=100&amp;amp;c2stat=&amp;amp;c2comp=gt&amp;amp;c2val=&amp;amp;c3stat=&amp;amp;c3comp=gt&amp;amp;c3val=&amp;amp;c4stat=&amp;amp;c4comp=gt&amp;amp;c4val=&amp;amp;order_by=games_goalie" target="_blank"&gt;Bernier is 13th in games played among goalies 26 or younger since the start of the 2007 season&lt;/a&gt; when he entered the league - for comparison, Price and Mason have both played in &lt;i&gt;twice&lt;/i&gt; as many games as Bernier. If we cut off that list at a minimum of 100 games played, that gives us 21 goalies. Bernier is 8th in save percentage (right behind Quick and Price, it's fun to note) but 13th in shots against. So though Bernier might look like an above average young goalie, but we don't actually know because he's faced a below average number of shots. (Holtby, for example, has faced slightly less than 100 more shots than Bernier, but boasts the 2nd best save percentage in the group.)&lt;br /&gt;All of this is to say I have no idea whether or not the Leafs should retain Bernier this summer. I am of two minds:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the one hand, Bernier is young enough that it might be worth the Leafs retaining him long-term just so they have at least &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; average goaltending during the rebuild, to maintain team morale and the like. Look at what poor goaltending has done to the culture in Edmonton.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the other hand, Bernier might want to get paid (with term) because he wasn't &lt;i&gt;terrible&lt;/i&gt; this year. His agent can point to his regular season numbers and Quick's contract and say "Who's to say Bernier wouldn't have won a Cup had he been given an opportunity like Quick?" And in that case, wouldn't the Leafs be better off trading his rights for a decent pick in this summer's draft?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The Leafs are going to be bad for a while yet. Paying a lot of money to a decent goalie is something they can afford to do but I have no idea whether or not it's something they need to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;James Reimer, 26, G:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;9-16-1, 0 SO, .907 SV%, 3.16 GAA, 11 QS, 7 RBS in 35 games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career: 74-64-16, 11 SO, .913 SV%, 78 QS, 30 RBS in 175 games&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UFA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drafted by John Ferguson, Jr. 99th overall in 2006&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Had the team not imploded despite decent goaltending, not trusting Reimer as his #1 goalie might have come to be the best decision of Nonis' brief tenure. Let's go back to that list we talked about for Bernier - Reimer is tied with Bernier in games played despite coming up in 2010. That's because Reimer was never the backup behind one of the NHL's star goalies. So initially Reimer got more starts. Then, of course, Nonis didn't trust Reimer despite his .923 playoff save percentage, and now things are more equal. They are, for all intents and purposes, the same age. So let's look a little closer. All this is relative to the other goalies "26" and under who have played in at least 100 NHL games as of the end of the 2014-15 season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table&gt; &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;th&gt;Player&lt;/th&gt;  &lt;th&gt;Games&lt;/th&gt;  &lt;th&gt;Min&lt;/th&gt;  &lt;th&gt;Wins&lt;/th&gt;  &lt;th&gt;Loses&lt;/th&gt;  &lt;th&gt;Others&lt;/th&gt;  &lt;th&gt;SOs &lt;/th&gt;  &lt;th&gt;Shots Against&lt;/th&gt;  &lt;th&gt;Save %age&lt;/th&gt;  &lt;th&gt;GAA&lt;/th&gt;  &lt;th&gt;QS &lt;/th&gt;  &lt;th&gt;RBS&lt;/th&gt;  &lt;th&gt;GPS&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;th&gt;Jonathan Bernier&lt;/th&gt;  &lt;td&gt;175 (tied 13th)&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;9720 (13th)&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;76 (13th)&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;64 (12th)&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;20 (11th)&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;9 (15th)&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;5076 (13th)&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;.916 (8th)&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;2.64 (13th)&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;87* (13th)&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;24* (12th)&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;32 (12th)&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;James Reimer&lt;/th&gt;  &lt;td&gt;175 (tied 13th)&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;9367 (14th)&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;74 (tied 15th)&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;67 (13th)&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;16 (5th)&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;11 (14th)&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;5198 (11th)&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;.913 (13th)&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;2.90 (19th)&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;78 (16th)&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;30 (13th)&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;31.1 (13th))&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;*Bernier played before QS and RBS were recorded.&lt;br /&gt;Holy shit, those are two &lt;i&gt;very similar&lt;/i&gt; goaltenders. Bernier wins, but barely. And remember Bernier played on a significantly better team for his first 62 games.&lt;br /&gt;So, I know this might sound crazy, but maybe the Leafs are better off trading Bernier's rights for something and signing Reimer at a discount - because of his shitty year - and just living with slightly below average goaltending during the rebuild? The Leafs save money (not important) and potentially get another valuable asset (much more important) while employing a known commodity in goal, who they have no pressure to make the long-term goalie, provided he doesn't turn back into Optimus Reim.&amp;nbsp; Is that crazy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Dion Phaneuf, 29, D:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;3G, 26A for 29P, -11 in 70 games; 23:43 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career 82-game average: 13G, 31A for 43P, -1; 24:45 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UFA in 2022, Cap Hit of $7 mil per season&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acquired by Brian Burke with Keith Aulie and Fredril Sjostrom for Niklas Hagman, Jamal Mayers, Matt Stajan and Ian White&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Now regardless of what you thought of the trade that brought him here (as a reminder, I did not like it even though I am one of perhaps two Leafs fans who still feels this way), Nonis' re-signing of Phaneuf to such a long-term deal was &lt;a href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.ca/2014/01/the-campaign-to-fire-dave-nonis-dion.html" target="_blank"&gt;idiotic at the time&lt;/a&gt; and stands as perhaps the second or third biggest mistake of his tenure. In four and a half seasons in Calgary, Phaneuf averaged .6 PPG and nearly 25 minutes per game. In five-ish seasons in Toronto, Phaneuf has averaged .53 PPG and 24 minutes per game. That seems like there has been only a slight decline. However, Phaneuf was already showing signs of offensive decline before the fabeled trade and only his first couple seasons in Toronto elevate his PPG here above half a point. Phaneuf's ice-time was also dropping in Calgary - remember he lost his #1 job to Jay Bouwmeester - but then he was asked to play over 25 minutes per game in Toronto from the day he arrived until the end of the lock-out shortened season. The last two seasons he have played on 23 minutes per game for the first time since his last half season in Calgary, now that Toronto has other D.&lt;br /&gt;Why does this matter? Perhaps it was just the circumstance in Calgary (and at the WJCs) that made it appear Phaneuf was going to become one of the next great offensive D in the NHL. Or perhaps Phaneuf learned to take less offensive chances over time. Perhaps it was circumstance that made Phaneuf look like a legitimate #1 D in the NHL and &lt;a href="http://www.hockey-reference.com/awards/voting-2008.html#norris" target="_blank"&gt;even finish &lt;i&gt;second&lt;/i&gt; in Norris trophy voting one year&lt;/a&gt;. Whatever it was, we now know better. Phaneuf is not a #1 D in the NHL. He is also not one of the top offensive D in the league - since he came to the Leafs, &lt;a href="http://www.hockey-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;amp;match=combined&amp;amp;year_min=2010&amp;amp;year_max=2015&amp;amp;season_start=1&amp;amp;season_end=-1&amp;amp;rookie=N&amp;amp;age_min=0&amp;amp;age_max=99&amp;amp;birth_country=&amp;amp;franch_id=&amp;amp;is_active=&amp;amp;is_hof=&amp;amp;pos=D&amp;amp;handed=&amp;amp;c1stat=games_played&amp;amp;c1comp=gt&amp;amp;c1val=350&amp;amp;c2stat=&amp;amp;c2comp=gt&amp;amp;c2val=&amp;amp;c3stat=&amp;amp;c3comp=gt&amp;amp;c3val=&amp;amp;c4stat=&amp;amp;c4comp=gt&amp;amp;c4val=&amp;amp;order_by=points_per_game" target="_blank"&gt;he is 28th in PPG among D to have played at least 350 games&lt;/a&gt;, i.e. the top offensive option on one of the worst teams in the league, which he was.&lt;br /&gt;What he &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; is a workhorse. Phaneuf has played the 6th most games of any D since he entered the league, and he is only behind on that list because he missed 12 games this season. (&lt;a href="http://www.hockey-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;amp;match=combined&amp;amp;year_min=2006&amp;amp;year_max=2015&amp;amp;season_start=1&amp;amp;season_end=-1&amp;amp;rookie=N&amp;amp;age_min=0&amp;amp;age_max=99&amp;amp;birth_country=&amp;amp;franch_id=&amp;amp;is_active=&amp;amp;is_hof=&amp;amp;pos=D&amp;amp;handed=&amp;amp;c1stat=games_played&amp;amp;c1comp=gt&amp;amp;c1val=&amp;amp;c2stat=&amp;amp;c2comp=gt&amp;amp;c2val=&amp;amp;c3stat=&amp;amp;c3comp=gt&amp;amp;c3val=&amp;amp;c4stat=&amp;amp;c4comp=gt&amp;amp;c4val=&amp;amp;order_by=time_on_ice" target="_blank"&gt;He is &lt;i&gt;4th&lt;/i&gt; in ice time&lt;/a&gt;.) Phaneuf is a Top 2 - at least for the moment - and he can eat minutes like crazy. But he is 30 and he has a really long contract that isn't exactly cheap. A team with an up and coming #1 D who could benefit from having a veteran on that pairing would likely cherish a minutes-eater like Phaneuf. The question is, which team would that be? Because it doesn't make any sense for the Leafs to keep him, now that the rebuild is official. He will just be asked to continue to do too much. My hope is the Leafs can get something back for him - since he is a valuable player in the right circumstance - rather than having to pay someone to take the contract. If he stays here, he will continue to be attacked by the media, he will take up cap space, and he will continue to get played way too much. (Unfortunately, Phaneuf has a "limited" no trade clause, making him harder to deal.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Jake Gardiner, 24, D:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;4G, 20A for 34P, -23 in 79 games, 20:58 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career 82-game average: 7G, 23A for 30P, -10, 21:10 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UFA in 2019, Cap Hit of $4.05 mil per season&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acquired by Brian Burke with Joffrey Lupul and a 4th round pick (later traded) for Francois Beauchemin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;One of the great deals of Burke's tenure was to trade a defenseman perceived to be "struggling" (at least perceived by Torontonians to be struggling) for three assets, one of which was a rather unheralded prospect at the position. Now, I have taken issue with Burke's obsession with players he is familiar with to the extent that much of my book is about how ridiculous that was, but in this case he was dead right. Though Gardiner has struggled with consistency since his rookie season, I believe he has the skill-set, talent and "hockey IQ" to be a successful Top 4 (perhaps even Top 2) D on a good team in this league. Remember, he's only just 24. His coaches have had trouble trusting him, which is something I have personally struggled with, given my beliefs as to how bad the Leafs truly were. (Though I must say, the one time they did trust him over Franson, &lt;a href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.ca/2013/09/why-did-leafs-even-trade-for-cody.html" target="_blank"&gt;I was mystified&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;Though this may sound extreme to some, to me Gardiner is borderline untouchable. If I were running things, I would want a younger, better D prospect in return plus another asset. Why a second asset? Because at this point Gardiner has nearly 250 NHL games under his belt and he is a known commodity. A younger D is unlikely to have that kind of experience and I want something to hedge the bet. Far as I'm concerned, I am truly content to make Gardiner one of the two future cornerstones at his position going forward, at least until an alternative comes along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Mogan Rielly, 20, D:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;8G, 21A for 29P, -16, 20:20 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career 82-game average: 5G, 25A for 30P, -16; 19:03 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RFA in 2016, Cap Hit of $0.85 mil per season&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drafted by Brian Burke 5th overall in 2012 &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;It's safe to say that, prior to this summer's draft, the Leafs have at least two legitimate prospects. One of them is Rielly - though I guess at this point he's "graduated" - and he represents the Leafs' future at the position. Rielly, at 20, is better than Gardiner at 24 (at least I think he is, which isn't saying much). In the old NHL it might have been a little crazy to be building your team around two mobile, "puck moving" D, but this isn't the old NHL. (As demonstrated by the lack of success of Luke Schenn so far in his career. Had Schenn been born 10 years earlier, I feel like things would have turned out very different for him.) As far as I'm concerned the Leafs should be thinking about a "bridge" contract already. Let's get him locked up now. He's the most untouchable player on the team&amp;nbsp; probably by a long shot - and the only other player of comparable youth and value in the Leafs' organization hasn't played a game in the NHL yet (for once!!!). Extend this guy ASAP before he has a better year next season and gets paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Tyler Bozak, 28, C:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;23G, 26A for 49P, -34 in 82 games; 19:09 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career 82-game average: 21G, 30A for 50P, -16&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UFA in 2018, Cap Hit of $4.2 mil per season&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Signed by Brian Burke as an amateur free agent on April 3, 2009&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Bozak initially represented the most successful of Burke's creative amateur and non-NHL pro free agent signings. He really was the only one that turned into an NHL player. Unfortunately, for far too long the Leafs have played him as if he was the heir to Mats' old role on the team, and the results have been disastrous. Bozak has maintained second line offensive production in first line minutes despite regularly playing with one of the best wingers in the league on his wing. And the defensive results have been worse.&lt;br /&gt;Bozak's career year in 2013-14 - after he signed his extension - vindicated his place on the team in the eyes of many, for some reason. But that would have been the time to trade him. (Of course, Nonis, a Bozak fan, was still in charge.) Bozak began this year continuing to on a similar pace: he had 22 points through November - nearly half his total for the year - good for a point per game. That also would have been the time to trade him. Of course, the Leafs were then under the impression that this team was competitive because of a winning streak, and because Nonis was still in charge.&lt;br /&gt;Given how poorly the rest of his season went, I think it's going to be hard to find a decent buyer, especially given Bozak's limited no trade clause.&lt;br /&gt;So one option is to throw him into that #1 spot again, despite the evidence to the contrary (and provided, of course, that Kessel, the man who keeps him going, is still around), and hope that he starts the season on a tear, and &lt;i&gt;then trade him&lt;/i&gt;. The other option is to hope that at least one GM of a team Bozak will accept a trade to thinks about hockey like the writers of the Toronto Star or Sun, and thinks Bozak is great. That might also work. Either way, it's hard to see a future for a player like him here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;James van Riemsdyk, 25, LW:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;27G, 29A for 56P, -33 in 82 games; 19:05 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career 82-game average: 25G, 25A for 50P, -7; 17:03 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UFA in 2018, Cap Hit of $4.25 mil per season&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acquired by Brian Burke for Luke Schenn on June 23, 2012&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;This is the one trade Burke made that I (lightly) criticized him for where I &lt;a href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.ca/2012/06/campaign-to-fire-brian-burke-schenn-for.html"&gt;really screwed the pooch&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; I believe my reasoning was sound - wingers have less to learn in the NHL than D, therefore take the young D over the young wing - however I failed to recognize how the league was changing. As I alluded to above, Schenn's breed is dying out. He's not mobile enough, despite his other abilities, to be the Top 4 D that many of us (me perhaps more than most) thought he would be when he seemed NHL-ready during his rookie season. So Burke was right to get rid of him.&lt;br /&gt;Burke was also right to take a chance on a guy who was not getting enough playing time in Philly. Though JVR's numbers look nearly identical to Bozak's, JVR has been a .7 PPG player since coming to Toronto, something Bozak has only ever managed in parts of two seasons (his rookie season, when he played in 37 games, and his career year, when he played in 58). JVR is clearly a better offensive payer than Bozak, in addition to be younger. Also, JVR showed up perhaps more than any other forward during the Leafs playoff run. I'm not one for "intangibles" too much of the time, but that's an intangible I like. (By "showing up", I mean he had 33 shots on goal in 138 minutes.)&lt;br /&gt;This is perhaps the hardest question of any for the team going into this summer: Is JVR young enough and good enough to survive the rebuild? &lt;a href="http://www.pensionplanpuppets.com/2015/4/6/8357587/should-james-van-riemsdyk-survive-the-rebuild" target="_blank"&gt;This PPP post makes a good argument&lt;/a&gt;: it depends on how long the rebuild is expected to last. That's not something we can really predict. Too many variables. So I think what the Leafs need to do is hedge: keep him initially - I doubt his value will go down - and if things are on track fast, extend him. If things are still shitty in, say, the summer of 2017, maybe then think about trading him. Of course, if some idiot comes along and offers a so-called "Godfather" offer for JVR, then they should by all means take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Phil Kessel, 27, RW:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;25G, 36A for 61P, -34 in 82 games, 18:48 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career 82-game average: 30G, 34A for 64P, -9; 18:16 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UFA in 2022, Cap Hit of $8 mil&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acquired by Brian Burke for two 1st round picks (Tyler Seguin, Dougie Hamilton) and one 2nd (Jared Knight)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Until this season, there were lots of people who still wanted to defend "The Trade", somehow insisting that trading two likely very high first round picks (&lt;i&gt;plus another pick&lt;/i&gt;!!!) for a former Top 5 pick made any kind of sense at the time; people who thought that Kessel's offensive ability (a .9 PPG player in Toronto so far, and that's after this disappointing season) somehow made up for the fact that the Bruins &lt;i&gt;won a Stanley Cup&lt;/i&gt; without him, and relying on contributions from only &lt;i&gt;one&lt;/i&gt; of the three players they got in return; or who think that Boston's subsequent mistake in trading away Seguin (which maybe wasn't a mistake, depending on who you talk to...) somehow makes Burke's decision more inherently intelligent, as if any GM can predict what any other GM will do &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; a trade, with those assets acquired in the trade. All of that should be ancient history at this point. I should stop bringing it up.&lt;br /&gt;What we do know is that, prior to this season, Kessel was pretty much point-per-game player for the Maple Leafs (he was that or better from 2011-2014), at a time when it's pretty hard to be a point-per-game player in the NHL. And, this season, he still led the team in points and PPG, despite some struggles (he had a terrible January to April).&lt;br /&gt;Yes, he has a long contract. But he's not exactly old. And it's hard to see why a smart team with a legitimate first line centre (i.e. not a Bozak) wouldn't want someone of Kessel's ability on their team, provided they have the cap room. Actually, I think it's fairly conceivable that someone would &lt;i&gt;make cap room&lt;/i&gt; for a player of Kessel's ability. I think it's only in Toronto where Kessel is perceived to be lazy. Smart executives on other teams no different. Kessel will never, ever, ever be even a poor man's Selke candidate, but that's not why it would be a valuable addition to any up and coming NHL team. He might even be the offensive piece that tips a team over the top.&lt;br /&gt;Why am I speaking as if we know he will be traded for sure? Well, this was Kessel's team. Sure it was also Phaneuf's, but Kessel was Burke's bid to get a franchise player without having to wait to draft one. That bid failed - Kessel clearly cannot do everything by himself - and it's necessary to acknowledge this by moving on from the Kessel era. Also, I really liked Detroit's old "Lidstrom rule" - the idea that no one on the team could earn more than Lidstrom while he was still around. I feel like team's probably do have beliefs like this that we don't know about. I feel like as long as Kessel is a Leaf, there's a defacto "Kessel rule" that nobody else will make as much as him, because it's his team.&amp;nbsp; I hope the Leafs will have some kind of future well before the summer of 2022 (maybe in 2020?) and I would like to think they can afford to supplement this core with free agents and not have to worry about whether or not they are paid more than Kessel. (Of course, the cap will be higher. This might all be moot.)&lt;br /&gt;I think it's culturally the thing to do. No more Kessel, no more Phaneuf says that this is a new era even more than firing Nonis, all the coaches and a whole bunch of scouts.&lt;br /&gt;(Of course, if Kessel &lt;i&gt;wants&lt;/i&gt; to stay - and I can't imagine why he would the way the media beats up on him - and wants to contribute as something other than the team's best player, that is another story. But that's a conversation that should happen ASAP if it hasn't happened already.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Nazem Kadri, 24, C:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;18G, 21A for 39P, -7 in 73 games; 17:36 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career 82-game average: 21G, 29A for 50P, -2; 17:44 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RFA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drafted by Brian Burke 7th overall in 2009&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Kadri was the Tavares consolation prize. And after worrying everyone that he was a bust for a few years (in part because we Leafs fans are idiots and in part because the Leafs treated him like every other prospect and brought up and sent him down ad infinitum), he made "the Leap". However, that Leap came from a ridiculously high shooting percentage and since Kadri has been putting up second line type numbers.&lt;br /&gt;But there's a caveat or, rather, a couple. For one thing Kadri has regularly been handed fairly terrible linemates (though that has changed over the years). For another thing, despite being clearly better than Bozak, he has never been given the #1 spot for more than a few shifts at a time. So we don't really know what he would do playing with an offensive player like Kessel for 82 games. We do know &lt;a href="http://www.pensionplanpuppets.com/2014/4/18/5580946/some-perspective-on-nazem-kadri" target="_blank"&gt;that he is a fantastic possession player&lt;/a&gt;, despite his lack of first line offence (so far). The behavioural issues may or may not be real - I suspect they are a least a little manufactured - but he's still young and he's the only forward on the team that is both young and can drive possession in the way that teams are focusing on now.&lt;br /&gt;It strikes me as a far more obvious choice to retain Kadri than JVR. Even if Kadri never becomes a legitimate first line centre in the league, it's clear he's a legitimate second line centre. And if the Leafs can extend him at a reasonable salary, it's at least tempting to view him as the #2 to Nylander's #1 once Nylander enters the league (and provided Nylander proves to be &lt;a href="http://www.hockeydb.com/ihdb/stats/pdisplay.php?pid=166009" target="_blank"&gt;as good as he looks&lt;/a&gt; - point per game player as an 18-year-old in the SEL (or whatever it's called now), and then a point per game player at the same age in the AHL).&lt;br /&gt;(All of this is not even considering the Leafs' 4th overall pick this summer.)&lt;br /&gt;Let's put to rest that this guy is a bust. Even without getting into "Computer Stats" (thanks Joe!), Kadri is 6th in his draft class in goals, 10th in assists, and 8th in points, all while playing in &lt;i&gt;significantly fewer games&lt;/i&gt; than everyone above him on that list (with the exception of Craig Smith, who has one more goal than Kadri in 27 more games). Of players to have played in at least 250 games since 2010-11 while still being 24 or younger as of February 1, 2014, &lt;a href="http://www.hockey-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;amp;match=combined&amp;amp;year_min=2011&amp;amp;year_max=2015&amp;amp;season_start=1&amp;amp;season_end=-1&amp;amp;rookie=N&amp;amp;age_min=0&amp;amp;age_max=24&amp;amp;birth_country=&amp;amp;franch_id=&amp;amp;is_active=&amp;amp;is_hof=&amp;amp;pos=S&amp;amp;handed=&amp;amp;c1stat=games_played&amp;amp;c1comp=gt&amp;amp;c1val=249&amp;amp;c2stat=&amp;amp;c2comp=gt&amp;amp;c2val=&amp;amp;c3stat=&amp;amp;c3comp=gt&amp;amp;c3val=&amp;amp;c4stat=&amp;amp;c4comp=gt&amp;amp;c4val=&amp;amp;order_by=points_per_game" target="_blank"&gt;Kadri is 20th in points per game&lt;/a&gt;. All the while, often have shitty linemates and generally not getting opportunities to star for the Leafs. I think that's pretty impressive. A keeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Roman Polak, 28, D:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;5G, 4A for 9P, -22 in 56 games, 21:05 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career 82-game average: 3G, 12A for 15P, -5; 19:15 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UFA in 2016, Cap Hit of $2.75 mil per season&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acquired by Dave Nonis for Carl Gunnarsson and a 4th round pick (Ville Husso)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Nonis made a number of stupid decisions during his tenure, but among the trades he made perhaps none was more &lt;a href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.ca/2014/06/the-campaign-to-fire-dave-nonis-roman.html" target="_blank"&gt;mind bogglinly stupid&lt;/a&gt; than trading Gunnarsson &lt;i&gt;plus a pick&lt;/i&gt; for Polak, a demonstrably worse player. Certainly one of the many causes of this disaster of a season was that Gunnarsson was now playing depth D for the Blues, instead of handing Top 4 minutes in Toronto.&lt;br /&gt;The problem for the Leafs going forward here is it's hard to see how they are going to move Polak for much prior to his contract expiring. The best thing to do would be to try to get someone to take him as a depth D near the 2016 trade deadline, I think. But who knows. It's hard to see a modern, educated front office wanting to give up much for Polak, a depth D on one of the worst teams in the league.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Leo Komarov, 28, C/LW:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;8G, 18A for 26P, 0 in 62 games, 14:42 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career 82-game average: 10G, 18A for 28P, -1; 14:23 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UFA in 2018; $2.95 mil per season&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drated by John Ferguson Jr. 180th overall in 2006&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Fan favourite Komarov was brought back after he bolted to Russia in 2013, presumaby for more money. I find his salary a little high, but that's probably unreasonable given the constant cap increases. Komarov does what he does very well and frankly I see no need to move him unless he's threatening to go back to Russia again or the Leafs cannot move their NTC players and need the cap space. It's good to have people like him around, no?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Peter Holland, 24, C:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;11G, 14A for 25P, 0 in 62 games; 14:31 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career 82-game average: 13G, 13A for 26P, +3; 12:47 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RFA in 2016, Cap Hit of $0.775 mil per season&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acquired by Dave Nonis with Brad Staubitz for Jesse Blacker, a 2nd round pick (Marcus Pettersson) and a 7th rounder (Ondrej Kase)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Holland had a career year this year, offensively anyway. And that's because he was entrusted with almost double the minutes he had ever been given before. Young, cheap, dependable players like this are well worth keeping. Next year will obviously determine what kind of money they have to fork over to retain him, and only then will it make sense to think about extending versus moving, unless of course the Leafs think he is good for the younger players.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Stephane Robidas, 37, D:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1G, 6A for 7P,&amp;nbsp;+8 in 52 games; 17:04 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career 82-game average: 5G, 17A for 23P,&amp;nbsp;+1; 20:19 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UFA 2017; Cap Hit of $3 mil per season&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Signed by Dave Nonis in 2014&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Ugh. Robidas was one of my favourite players after he dominated the Stars last decent playoff run. But he is a long way from that now, with serious injury problems and (probably) an untradeable contract. The Leafs may have to sit on this one, though if they traded Clarkson, anything is possible. What a bizarre &lt;a href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.ca/2014/07/the-campaign-to-fire-dave-nonis.html" target="_blank"&gt;signing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Richard Panik, 23, RW:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;11G, 6A for 17P, -8 in 76 games; 11:39 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career 82-game average: 11G, 11A for 21P, -10; 11:56 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RFA this summer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acquired by Dave Nonis via waivers on October 9, 2014&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The decision on whether or not to retain Panik probably has as much to do with deciding as to how to fill out the roster next season as it does with evaluating Panik's own potential as a bottom six. I mean, if the Leafs are tanking that means they must populate the roster with borderline NHL players - is Panik one of them or not? He actually had his worst PPG this year, so that suggests maybe he is a little something more and the circumstances contributed to his lack of success.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like players like him are pretty common. On the other hand, he's very young.I don't really have an opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Joffrey Lupul, 31, LW:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;10G, 11A for 21P, - 10 in 55 games; 15:29 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career 82-game average: 25G, 26A for 49P, -9; 16:21 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UFA in 2018, Cap Hit of $5.25 mil per season&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acquired by Brian Burke with Jake Gardiner and a 4th Rounder (Fredrik Bergvik) for Francois Beauchemin&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Goddman you Nonis. Lupul is overpaid and always injured. &lt;a href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.ca/2013/01/the-campaign-to-get-leafs-to-truly_21.html" target="_blank"&gt;Who could have possibly seen that coming?&lt;/a&gt; Not just me, mind you. I'm sure everyone but Dave Nonis and the rest of the Leafs front office so this coming. Lupul and his agent probably saw it coming. An oft-injured player just shy of 30 coming off a career year. Oh yes, let's sign him to a long term deal! (Lupul couldn't believe his luck no doubt.)&lt;br /&gt;And now, with Lupul once again experiencing injury trouble, but this time also seeing his worst PPG since he was in Edmonton and his lowest ice time since coming the Leafs, it's hard to imagine who wants this guy. Seriously, why would you trade for him?&lt;br /&gt;My hope is that Lupul is healthy in the Fall and goes on a bit of a tear. But I doubt it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;David Booth, 30, LW:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;7G, 6A for 13P, -8 in 59 games; 11:56 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career 82-game average: 20G, 18A for 38P, -4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UFA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Signed by Dave Nonis in July 2014&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Obviously we all know Booth's career as a top 6 forward is long over. The question is he valuable as a bottom six. That's a possession numbers question, which I am too lazy to answer. My concern is that players like Booth are a little too expensive compared to some younger just as talented players. I see no need to re-sign him unless there's a discount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Trevor Smith, C:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2G, 3A for 5P, -9 in 54 games; 11:04 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career 82-game average: 7G, 8A for 16P, -10; 11:08 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UFA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Signed by Dave Nonis in July 2013&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;It is perhaps a testament to the Leafs' current state that Smith played in a career high number of games this season. He's cheap, anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Eric Brewer, 35, D:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2G, 3A for 5P, -4 in 18 games; 20:12 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career 82-game average: 7G, 16A for 22P, -8; 21:53 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UFA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acquired by Dave Nonis with a 5th Rounder in 2016 for Korbinian Holzer&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The Leafs got a 5th Round pick for Holzer by taking on Brewer's contract for a few months. I think that's what happened. I would be really, really surprised if Brewer is re-signed. He should probably retire.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Tim Erixon, 23, D:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1G, 0A for 1P, -5 in 15 games; 15:48 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career AHL 82-game average: 8G, 54A for 62P, +6 (ice time not available)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RFA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acquired by Dave Nonis off waivers on March 1, 2015&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Erixon has established himself as a strong offensive D in the AHL, but has yet to be able to stay up with any NHL team. I'm not sure 15 games on a terrible team is a good try out. But if they didn't see anything there's no reason to keep him. If, on the other hand, they need a cheap option for a tank at the #6 spot, perhaps Erixon's the guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Joakim Lindstrom, 31, C:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1G, 3A for 4P, -7 in 19 games; 10:03 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career 82-game average: 11G, 13A for 24P, -18; 11:52 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UFA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acquired by Dave Nonis with a 6th rounder in 2016 for Olli Jokinen, March 2, 2015&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Lindstrom has only played 150 games even though he is 31. He was the price the Leafs had to pay for getting a 6th round pick for Jokinen (a player whose career is pretty much over). I can't imagine he'd be back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Andrew McWilliam, 24, D:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;0G, 2A for 2P, -6 in 12 games; 15:24 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career AHL 82-game average: 2G, 9A for 11A,&amp;nbsp;+18 (ice time not available)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RFA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drafted by Cliff Fletcher 188th overall in 2008&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;McWilliams is a 7th D at best, probably. A defensive D in an era where it's becoming more and more important to move the puck. I could be totally wrong. It's not like I've seen him play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Zach Sill, 26, C:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;0G, 1A for 1P, -2 in 21 games; 8:34 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career 82-game average: 1G, 3A for 4P, -9; 8:58 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;UFA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acquired by Dave Nonis with a 4th Rounder this year and a 2nd Rounder in 2016 for Daniel Winnik. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Sill has managed to play 83 games in the NHLsince 2013. He has literally no offensive ability. A depth guy who has "truculence". No reason to keep him. Dime a dozen. (&lt;a href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.ca/2015/02/the-campaign-to-fire-dave-nonis-winnik.html" target="_blank"&gt;I was unhappy that he was acquired by the Leafs in the first place&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Stuart Percy, 21, D:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;0G, 3A for 3P, -4 in 9 games; 18:05 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career AHL 82-game average: 4G, 23A for 28P, +3 (ice time unavailable)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rookie two-way deal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drafted by Brian Burke 25th overall in 2011&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Percy has the distinction of being the only Maple Leaf draft pick I saw play live &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; he was drafted. (So clearly he should be honoured. I remember thinking he was the best player in that Majors game. And so I've always had a soft spot for him even though Burke went slightly off the board to acquire him.&lt;br /&gt;I am cautiously optimistic that Percy will turn into a viable NHL player. And he'll be around for a while anyway. Ihink the smart thing to do would be to throw him to the wolves a litle bit next season. Give him a regular role on the team and see how he fares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Brandon Kozun, 24, RW:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2G, 2A for 4P, -3 in 20 games; 7:55 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career AHL 82-game average: 23G, 30A for 53P, +6  (ice time not available)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RFA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Acquired by Dave Nonis for Andrew Crescenzi on January 22, 2014&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Kozun is a successful AHL Top 6 forward but this was his only chance in the NHL to date. He obviously didn't impress but didn't get much time either. I guess he could be an effective bottom six next season if the price is right. Who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Sam Carrick, 22, C:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1G, 1A for 2P,&amp;nbsp;+1 in 16 games; 6:29 ATOIT&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career AHL 82-game average: 15G, 24A for 39P,&amp;nbsp;+20 (ice time not available)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Rookie two-way deal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drafted by Brian Burke 144th overall in 2010&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Though he's still young, Carrick hasn't even managed to be a Top 6 forward in the AHL. He racks up the penalty minutes which is likely why Burke drafted him. Hard to see him making an impact for the Leafs in the future. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;T.J. Brennan, 25, D:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;0G, 1A for 1P, -7 in 6 games; 16:49 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Career AHL 82-game average: 19G, 36A for 55P, +4 (ice time not available)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minor league deal&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reacquired by Dave Nonis for Spencer Abbot on February 26, 2015&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Brennan has been a veryproductive D in the AHL for a while now. He has made it into just over half a season's worth of NHL games since he was drafted. A minor leaguer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That ends the list of players to play at least 100 minutes with the Leafs this season and who are still under contract. It's a list that makes me look forward to this summer's draft and to think hard about what the Leafs should do next season. (I say tank.) There is obviously some potential in the Leafs organization not on this list (specifically Nylander) but the cupboard looks pretty bare when you focus on the pro team. All I can say is that I hope to not have to be publishing a Campaign to Fire Brendan Shanahan in the coming years. I am optimistic though, given what has transpired since Carlyle's firing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again my apologies for publishing an unfinished version of this post. </content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/8429948261984515832/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=8429948261984515832&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/8429948261984515832" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/8429948261984515832" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/04/your-2014-15-toronto-maple-leafs.html" rel="alternate" title="Your 2014-15 Toronto Maple Leafs" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-1842240925390359490</id><published>2015-04-26T21:54:00.002-04:00</published><updated>2015-04-26T21:54:35.231-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2015"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Crime"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Documentary"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Hot Docs"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Internet"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Law"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Sexuality"></category><title type="text">Thought Crimes (2015, Erin Lee Carr)</title><content type="html">This is a provocative and morally ambiguous film about the so-called "Cannibal Cop", the NYPD police officer who was charged and convicted of conspiracy to kidnap women, without kidnapping any women, and certainly without eating anyone.&lt;br /&gt;The film is not the best technically made film you will ever seen. The pacing isn't perfect and some of the shots depicting the porn at issue were oddly distorted.&lt;br /&gt;However, this is still a must-see documentary. The film depicts the rather alarming nature of the "trial by outrage" of a person who actually didn't do the vast majority of the stuff he was accused of. His internet fantasies and Google search history are, instead, taken as proof that he would have eventually. (Please remember that this is where we are going with terrorism in Canada once C-51 passes, folks.) I can't tell you how alarming that is to me.&lt;br /&gt;The film sides with him, legally, which I think is correct, but lets you worry about the moral and ethical issues, as well as the nature of these types of disorders, without forcing you to a conclusion. And I love that in a documentary.&lt;br /&gt;Pretty near mandatory viewing, given how much we all use the internet.&lt;br /&gt;8/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/1842240925390359490/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=1842240925390359490&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/1842240925390359490" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/1842240925390359490" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/04/thought-crimes-2015-erin-lee-carr.html" rel="alternate" title="Thought Crimes (2015, Erin Lee Carr)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-2258429224076562290</id><published>2015-04-26T21:47:00.001-04:00</published><updated>2015-04-26T21:47:29.301-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2015"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Docudrama"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Hackers"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Movies"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Short Film"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Technology"></category><title type="text">The 414s (2015, Michael T.

Ballard</title><content type="html">This is a provocative page turner that raises lots of questions about  where late 20th century capitalism is headed. FYI, it's also the first  Ballard novel I've read, but I have seen both of the films that were  adapted from his books. I found it entertaining and mostly provocative,  but I did have a few issues.&lt;br /&gt;For one thing,  Sinclair is not that likeable to begin with. I hope that was a  deliberate choice but there is a part of me that thinks maybe I just  don't like Ballard (if Sinclair is meant to be him). Sinclair reminds me  of an old Britain that I don't think many of us miss: classist, sexist,  racist, and utterly unaware of that, to the point where he believes  he's the very opposite - the most civilized man in the room. But,  whether or not it was deliberate, it does make him a more interesting  character (if not entirely believable given what later happens).&lt;br /&gt;A  bigger issue with the novel is Ballard's view of psychiatry and  psychology (he seems to confuse the two) - he appears to a) not really  know what psychiatrists actually do in real life (or perhaps he's  willing to take a huge artistic license) and b) he seems to think  whatever it is they do is as dangerous as fascism, unfettered  capitalism, drug abuse and other such things. That's really odd to me  and it's a hard hook to hang a plot on, in my opinion. It works a lot  better than it should, to his credit, but it's still something that eats  at you as you read the novel.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I mostly enjoyed the story, and there was enough going on to keep me interested and guessing.&lt;br /&gt;7/10 </content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/7636561355452170874/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=7636561355452170874&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/7636561355452170874" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/7636561355452170874" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/04/super-cannes-2000-by-jg-ballard.html" rel="alternate" title="Super-Cannes (2000) by J.G.

Joseph Haydn: Cello Concerto No. 1 in C (10/10)&lt;/h4&gt;Haydn's first cello concerto is a fine piece of music but it strikes me  as typical of the era (though I don't really know that). Though the  cello is perhaps my favourite orchestral instrument I can't help but  compare this work to what came before - specially Bach's cello music,  which is probably the best ever written (or at least very close to  that). This is fine, really, and it certainly has a number of beautiful  passages for the instrument, but it's a little too classically Classical  (see what I did there?) for me. This is apparently the first cello concerto ever. So I really should just get over myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Joseph Haydn: Keyboard Concerto No. 2 in D (8/10)&lt;/h4&gt;The 2nd concerto is the oldest of the three (on the set I heard it on), the most typical (I assume)  and, oddly, the most pleasing. Again the orchestra feels like a valued  contributor to the work, perhaps even more so than in the 6th.&amp;nbsp; This is  probably as straightforward and unimaginative as classical piano  concertos by major composers get, but I find it less difficult to get my  head around than the other two in this package. I enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Joseph Haydn: Keyboard Concerto No 6 in F with violin and strings "Double Concerto" (8/10)&lt;/h4&gt;The so-called "Double Concerto" (#6) is not exactly what I think of when  I think of "double" concerti. (I think of two solo instruments.)  Despite its age, the work has a more developed orchestra part (to my  ears) than the 11th. It's altogether more of Haydn's style, to my ears.  And so I respect that more, even if it is a little too "classical" for  my taste. </content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/4077231879151400668/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=4077231879151400668&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/4077231879151400668" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/4077231879151400668" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/04/1760s-in-music.html" rel="alternate" title="1760s in Music" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-5530652933916185618</id><published>2015-04-22T19:00:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-04-25T11:59:49.158-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1760s"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1780s"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="2008"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Classical"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Concerto"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Music"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Piano music"></category><title type="text">Haydn: Piano Concertos in D / F (2008) by Ralf Gothoni, Finlandia Sinfonietta</title><content type="html">This is a hodgepodge of the 2nd, 6th and 11th concertos for keyboard, all played on a piano (shock horor).&lt;br /&gt;(In case you are not a classical music snob and have no idea what I'm joking about: pianos were invented well before this music was written but weren't very common until shortly after the 11th concerto was composed. Haydn was unlikely to have written for the piano, I'm guessing, until the 1790s, whereas the music on this disc was composed well before that.)&lt;br /&gt;The 11th concerto starts the disc. It's the only one I know of that might have actually been written for piano (maybe, it might have been written for harpsichord). It is the most famous of these concertos and supposedly the most Mozartian (which explains why I am not absolutely loving it, har har har). Mozart was overrated. Ahem.&lt;br /&gt;The piano part is showy (in a good way) but the orchestra sort of feels like an afterthought a lot of the time - in the first movement particularly. It was early days for the genre (invented by Bach - maybe? - only half a century earlier) and so that's entirely understandable. But the music often feels like it's introducing the piano passages, as if our ears were not to be trusted to just the piano.&lt;br /&gt;But the slow movement brings to mind the "Moonlight" sonata, so that's cool.&lt;br /&gt;The so-called "Double Concerto" (#6) is not exactly what I think of when I think of "double" concerti.

There is a little too much Manzarek here for my liking.  From the liner notes it sounds like the Doors cover and, perhaps, by extension, his involvement, was somehow a condition of the release, which is annoying and also not very "punk."  His organ adds something to their sound which was missing from most punk music of the era, but it is still a little odd that they didn't seem to know "Soul Kitchen" before they did it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;It's funny what nearly five years will do to one's tastes. Now I don't regret Manzarek's involvement at all - I find it a nice differentiator from other punk bands.&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I thought I had been surprised by how traditional punk this was, misremembering that I had expected something like Black Flag and instead got the American version of X-Ray Spex. Well, they're considersably more rock and roll / rootsy than X-Ray Spex but there is a slight similiarity in the female vocalists.&lt;br /&gt;This is relatively traditional punk for 1980 but it boasts stronger songs than most punk albums of that time, and their sensibility is unique and defined in a way that many of the punk bands that appeared around this time weren't able to accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;8/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/4989390170084941784/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=4989390170084941784&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/4989390170084941784" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/4989390170084941784" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/04/los-angeles-1980-by-x.html" rel="alternate" title="Los Angeles (1980) by X" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-7896318767370109561</id><published>2015-04-22T18:00:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-04-24T16:03:51.781-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1980"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Heavy Metal"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Music"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="New Wave of British Heavy Metal"></category><title type="text">British Steel (1980) by Judas Priest</title><content type="html">I have heard that this was sort of &lt;i&gt;the Black Album&lt;/i&gt; of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal - the genre's more popular and most accessible record to date. I don't know Judas Priest, and I have no idea how much of a departure this was from earlier Priest albums, but it's certainly sginificantly more accessible than Maiden or Motorhead (also, obviously far more "metal" than the latter).&lt;br /&gt;For years I have struggled with purposefully accessible music, wondering if artists sell out when they make their sound easier to access for the public. When I was young the idea seemed like a cardinal sin for artists. The older I get the less important I think it is - we all have to make a living and everyone (or at least the vast majority of us) wants to be successful.&lt;br /&gt;They walk a fine line but I think they walk it well: this is still very clearly what heavy metal was in 1980. You wouldn't mistake this for anything else or for the arena rock erroneously labelled "metal" that would soon appear. And yet it's also clear why this was a big hit: the hooks are stronger than other contemporaneous metal bands, there are singalong choruses and no song is too long.&lt;br /&gt;As someone else said, it's like AC/DC and Judas Priest had a baby. (Of course I don't know if that's really true, but it makes sense to me without knowing any better.)&lt;br /&gt;It doesn't exactly make me want to seek out any of their other "commercial" albums but it does make me want to hear what they sounded like before they went "commercial". And, if it helped expose more people to metal, then all the better.&lt;br /&gt;7/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/7896318767370109561/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=7896318767370109561&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/7896318767370109561" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/7896318767370109561" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/04/british-steel-1980-by-judas-priest.html" rel="alternate" title="British Steel (1980) by Judas Priest" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-4288401014970121328</id><published>2015-04-22T17:30:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-04-22T17:30:00.507-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1980"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Heavy Metal"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Music"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="New Wave of British Heavy Metal"></category><title type="text">Iron Maiden (1980)</title><content type="html">My knowledge of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal has been confined to Motorhead and the genre's influences (primarily Thrash) for most of my metal-listening life.

That couldn't be far from the truth. In fact, I barely hear the gallop here.&lt;br /&gt;Instead what I hear is a band that has managed to almost perfectly united the conventions of mid '70s metal (especially the guitar and vocal lines) with the pace, aggression and grit of first wave punk. In fact, Maiden sound, at times, even more dangerous than first wave punk. (And would all the time if their lyrics were political.)&lt;br /&gt;And whereas Motorhead definitely lean on the punk influence perhaps to the detriment of their metal side, it's obvious this is still a metal band.&lt;br /&gt;A great record.&lt;br /&gt;9/10</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/4288401014970121328/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=4288401014970121328&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/4288401014970121328" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/4288401014970121328" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/04/iron-maiden-1980.html" rel="alternate" title="Iron Maiden (1980)" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-8545641.post-7852091660383340668</id><published>2015-04-22T17:00:00.000-04:00</published><updated>2015-04-22T17:00:06.143-04:00</updated><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="1980"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Fantasy Metal"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Hard Rock"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Music"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="New Wave of British Heavy Metal"></category><category scheme="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#" term="Old School Heavy Metal"></category><title type="text">Heaven and Hell (1980) by Black Sabbath</title><content type="html">I'm struggling here, really struggling. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name='more'&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly don't know Sabbath post 1971. I've never gotten around to listening to those records because...well, there's a lot of music in the world. And I've been happy enough to listen to the first few albums. So I don't know what happened to Sabbath in the late seventies. Certainly there seems to be a consensus that they sucked.&lt;br /&gt;And I don't know Dio really. I know the legend of Dio, but I don't know him. I don't know Elf, I don't know Rainbow, I know maybe one song of his from movies (and honestly I don't know whether it's solo, Sabbath or something else). And I know of him from Tenacious D.&lt;br /&gt;And so I think I can imagine how Dio fronting Sabbath was refreshing. If the Ozzy Sabbath was really sucking and descending into self-parody, then maybe this was really refreshing - it certainly doesn't sound like the Sabbath I know, which is a &lt;i&gt;good&lt;/i&gt; thing, at least in theory (since, you know, it'd be a rather long time for them to be sounding the exact same).&lt;br /&gt;But I just can't get my head around Dio, now matter how legendary he is. His lyrics are &lt;i&gt;terrible&lt;/i&gt;. I know most metal lyrics are terrible but Dio's are extra terrible. Geezer Butler certainly stood out as one of the better (if not the best) lyricists within the early genre. And it's a real shame to me that Dio took over. (Apparently Butler almost quit the band around this time, so that helps explain it, I guess.)&lt;br /&gt;Now, it's always hard to listen listen many years in the future to a record that established conventions that have become cliches because it's hard for us moderns to not hear them as cliches. And so I'm sure some people want to tell me that Dio did these terrible, cheesy lyrics - and the whole over-singing thing - first. And for many people I'm sure this record stays on the side of "so cheesy it's awesome" as opposed to "so cheesy it's cheesy". And I would recognize the establishment of these conventions as a legitimate artistic achievement if Dio did indeed invent this kind of "fantasy" metal thing when he joined Sabbath. The problem is that even without knowing Elf and Rainbow, and without knowing what he sang about in those bands, this whole thing has indeed been done before.&lt;br /&gt;Dio's lyrics feel like the logical conclusion of Robert Plant's viking obsession and the Tolkienisation of metal lyrics that happened in some areas of early metal. Worse, Dio makes this version of Sabbath sound like the New Wave of British Heavy Metal version of Uriah Heap. I don't mean that as a complement.&lt;br /&gt;And Dio's voice sometimes sounds like a poor man's Ian Gillan. "Lady Evil" in particular sounds like a NWBHM tribute to Purple (minus the Jon Lord part).&lt;br /&gt;But despite my great dislike of this Dio-led Sabbath, the whole rest of the band still is (mostly) awesome. Iommi sounds like a completely different guitar player, which is to his credit. Butler and Ward also sound different. The whole band sounds as if they've taken the whole Priest/Motorhead revolution and fully integrated it into the Sabbath sound, virtually destroying the classic Sabbath sound. And I think that's a good thing. It's artistic growth!

Because I reject the deliberate ambiguity and controvsery created by the pro sports MVP award concept, I have imagined alternatives to the MVP award.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Gretzky (Best Skater) &lt;/h4&gt;Crosby vs. Ovechkin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sidney Crosby: 28G (tied 20th), 56A (tied 3rd), for 84P (3rd), +5 in 77 games, 19:58 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alex Ovechkin: 53G (1st), 28A for 81P (tied 4th), +10 in 81 games, 20:20 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&amp;nbsp;Crosby was:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;7th in Goals Created&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;10th in PP Goals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tied for 1st in APG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1st in PPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;7th in Goals Created Per Game&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;8th in OPS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;Ovechkin was:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;1st in Goals Created &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5th in Even Strength Goals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1st in PP Goals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1st in Game Winning Goals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1st in Shots&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1st in GPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;8th in PPG&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1st in Goals Created Per Game&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1st in OPS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5th in PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5th in TOI among forwards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;I am usually inclined to give this "award" to the player who led the league in PPG. However, I am tempted to give it to Ovechkin given his important to his team, even though that's a bit of a Hart type of interpretation. But that's not the true intent of the award, so &lt;b&gt;Crosby&lt;/b&gt; wins it this year, as he does most years. (If the award actually existed, this would be Crosby's fifth, and his third in a row.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Hart (Best Player on Best Team interpretation)&lt;/h4&gt;By this interpretation, I mean literally "the best player on the best team" (i.e., Steph Curry in the NBA). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, by points, points percentage, and &lt;a href="http://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/?p=37" target="_blank"&gt;Hockey Reference's Simple Rating System&lt;/a&gt;, this year's best team was the New York Rangers. And that means Rick Nash is your MVP, a sentence I never ever thought I would ever type, ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rick Nash&lt;/b&gt;: 42G, 27A for 69P, +29 in 79 games, 17:27 ATOI, 11.4 PS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, just for fun:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best offensive team this year was the Tampa Bay Lightning, so if we only cared about offense, the MVP would be&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Steven Stamko&lt;/b&gt;s: 43G, 29A for 72P, +2 in 82 games, 19:22 ATOI, 8.6 OPS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best defensive team this year was the Montreal Canadiens, so if we only cared about offense, the MVP (actually the MVS) would be&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;PK Subban&lt;/b&gt;: 15G, 45A for 60P, +21 in 82 games, 26:12 ATOI, 6.6 DPS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Hart (Literal interpretation)&lt;/h4&gt;By this interpretation I mean the "Most Valuable Skater" and yes, that means I exclude goalies (they have their own award and, were it up to me, they'd have multiple awards of their own) which means no Carey Price, shock, horror. (See below.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ovechkin led all skaters in Point Shares with 12.6 (or 13, for our purposes) and if we subtracted 13 points from the Capitals' total that would leave them with 88 points, meaning they would miss the playoffs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Well that was easy. I was expecting that to take a lot longer than that (it usually does). &lt;b&gt;Alex Ovechkin&lt;/b&gt; deserves the Hart (under this interpretation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually I then award my fake Hart to the player who gets some consideration in the former interpretation and the latter. However in this case both are pretty clear cut. I have always preferred the MVS interpretation, so &lt;b&gt;Ovechkin&lt;/b&gt; gets it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Norris&lt;/h4&gt;Doughty's ice time this year was insane - he is now &lt;a href="http://www.hockey-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;amp;match=single&amp;amp;year_min=&amp;amp;year_max=&amp;amp;season_start=1&amp;amp;season_end=-1&amp;amp;rookie=N&amp;amp;age_min=0&amp;amp;age_max=99&amp;amp;birth_country=&amp;amp;franch_id=&amp;amp;is_active=&amp;amp;is_hof=&amp;amp;pos=S&amp;amp;handed=&amp;amp;c1stat=time_on_ice&amp;amp;c1comp=gt&amp;amp;c1val=2300&amp;amp;c2stat=&amp;amp;c2comp=gt&amp;amp;c2val=&amp;amp;c3stat=&amp;amp;c3comp=gt&amp;amp;c3val=&amp;amp;c4stat=&amp;amp;c4comp=gt&amp;amp;c4val=&amp;amp;order_by=ps" target="_blank"&gt;one of only nine NHL skaters to play more than 2300 minutes in a season&lt;/a&gt;. And this alone probably warrants a strong case for the Norris. My &lt;a href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.ca/2012/07/best-defense-is-good-offense.html" target="_blank"&gt;semi-scientific, completely blind, not very good "method"&lt;/a&gt; picks &lt;b&gt;P.K. Subban&lt;/b&gt; this season, by both metrics, Point Share "rating" and Weighted Point Shares Per Game. So I'm glad it picked someone reasonable, unlike &lt;a href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.ca/2014/04/2013-14-nhl-awards.html" target="_blank"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Selke&lt;/h4&gt;I really need to read up on possession stats so I can actually authoritatively say something about this award. In the past I relied on a not very good method so for the second year in a row I will be bailing on this and saying "Hey, I'm totally okay if Bergeron, Datsyuk or Toews wins this". One for the book?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Vezina&lt;/h4&gt;I like the 2100 minute cut off mark - every year that usually gives us around 30 or so goalies to choose from in terms of these awards. This year, 31 goalies played 2100 minutes (last year it was 29 goalies). We all know where this is going so let's get to it. Among those goalies, &lt;b&gt;Carey Price&lt;/b&gt; was&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;5th in games played&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4th in games started&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1st in wins&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;21st in losses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;16th in others&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;14th in total goals against&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5th in shots against&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4th in made saves&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1st in save percentage as you know&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1st in GAA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;1st in goals against percentage (that's goals saved relative to the league average)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2nd in shut outs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4th in minutes played&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4th in quality starts (what is this, baseball?)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;6th in quality start percentage (seriously!)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;19th in "really bad starts" (yes, that's now a thing)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;and 1st in GPS (by over 2 points)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Also, of the goalies to face at least 1900 shots this season, Price has far and away the best save percentage. Of the goalies to play at least 3500 minutes, Price has far and away the best save percentage. It's no contest this year. It's why so many people want to give him the Hart. (But they shouldn't!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Hasek (Most Valuable Goalie)&lt;/h4&gt;I invented this because some years it really isn't that clear cut that the best goalie is also the most valuable. This is not one of those years. Take Price off the Habs and they drop out of the playoffs. Take Holtby off the Caps and the same thing happens, but the Caps weren't the best defensive team this year, nor did they tally 110 points. &lt;b&gt;Carey Price&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Calder&lt;/h4&gt;I always feel like if a defenseman shines as a rookie, that's more worth honouring than rookie forwards. The learning curve is sharper for D. Also, age plays a factor for me (it doesn't for many, who probably love that Makarov once won the rookie of the year). So, let me just say this: &lt;a href="http://www.hockey-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;amp;match=single&amp;amp;year_min=&amp;amp;year_max=&amp;amp;season_start=1&amp;amp;season_end=1&amp;amp;rookie=N&amp;amp;age_min=18&amp;amp;age_max=18&amp;amp;birth_country=&amp;amp;franch_id=&amp;amp;is_active=&amp;amp;is_hof=&amp;amp;pos=S&amp;amp;handed=&amp;amp;c1stat=games_played&amp;amp;c1comp=gt&amp;amp;c1val=&amp;amp;c2stat=&amp;amp;c2comp=gt&amp;amp;c2val=&amp;amp;c3stat=&amp;amp;c3comp=gt&amp;amp;c3val=&amp;amp;c4stat=&amp;amp;c4comp=gt&amp;amp;c4val=&amp;amp;order_by=ps" target="_blank"&gt;Here is a list of players by point shares in their age 18 season, in the history of the NHL&lt;/a&gt;. #1 is Crosby (which makes me think I was wrong to argue Ovechkin deserved the Calder that year). #2 is Aaron Ekblad. By Point Shares (a flawed metric if there ever was one), Ekblad has had the second greatest age 18 season of any skater in NHL history. So there's that. But if you don't like that, there's this:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aaron Ekblad&lt;/b&gt;: 12G, 27A for 39P, +12 in 81 games, 21:49 ATOI (#2 D on his team)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The guy just turned 19 years old. That's &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; impressive. Scoring 60-something points in your age 20 (Forsberg) or 21 season (Gaudreau) is not as impressive. That happens all the time, see: &lt;a href="http://www.hockey-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;amp;match=single&amp;amp;year_min=&amp;amp;year_max=&amp;amp;season_start=1&amp;amp;season_end=-1&amp;amp;rookie=N&amp;amp;age_min=20&amp;amp;age_max=20&amp;amp;birth_country=&amp;amp;franch_id=&amp;amp;is_active=&amp;amp;is_hof=&amp;amp;pos=S&amp;amp;handed=&amp;amp;c1stat=points&amp;amp;c1comp=gt&amp;amp;c1val=60&amp;amp;c2stat=&amp;amp;c2comp=gt&amp;amp;c2val=&amp;amp;c3stat=&amp;amp;c3comp=gt&amp;amp;c3val=&amp;amp;c4stat=&amp;amp;c4comp=gt&amp;amp;c4val=&amp;amp;order_by=points" target="_blank"&gt;age 20&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.hockey-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;amp;match=single&amp;amp;year_min=&amp;amp;year_max=&amp;amp;season_start=1&amp;amp;season_end=-1&amp;amp;rookie=N&amp;amp;age_min=21&amp;amp;age_max=21&amp;amp;birth_country=&amp;amp;franch_id=&amp;amp;is_active=&amp;amp;is_hof=&amp;amp;pos=S&amp;amp;handed=&amp;amp;c1stat=points&amp;amp;c1comp=gt&amp;amp;c1val=60&amp;amp;c2stat=&amp;amp;c2comp=gt&amp;amp;c2val=&amp;amp;c3stat=&amp;amp;c3comp=gt&amp;amp;c3val=&amp;amp;c4stat=&amp;amp;c4comp=gt&amp;amp;c4val=&amp;amp;order_by=points" target="_blank"&gt;age 21&lt;/a&gt;. Shouldn't we commemorate the historically great rookie season instead of the not particularly notable rookie season?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Jack Adams&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Peter Laviolette&lt;/b&gt;, as far as I'm concerned. I did not expect Nashville to be decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.blogger.com/null" name="team"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Team MVPs&lt;/h2&gt;This year I decided to do team MVPs as well because I've stopped watching games so that means I should say more! In reality, this is actually just a way for me to keep track who is decent, so I can do well on &lt;a href="http://www.sporcle.com/games/subcategory/nhl" target="_blank"&gt;sporcle quizzes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let's look at all the teams in the league and state their MVPs, staring from the worst, according to the Simple Rating System.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Buffalo Sabres (30th in GF, 29th in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;How could they possibly have an MVP? Well players don't tank, management does.&lt;br /&gt;Despite playing in only 27 games, Michal Neuvirth led the team in Point Shares - he was that good for them. However, he was traded away to help with the tank so we cannot give the award to him.&lt;br /&gt;Jonas Enroth came in second, but was also traded away.&lt;br /&gt;That leaves team's leading scorer as their MVP:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tyler Ennis&lt;/b&gt;: 20G, 26A for 46P, -19 in 78 games, 19:07 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Ennis actually had a better year than last year, so that's something and he's looking like a pretty decent late first round pick at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Arizona Coyotes (29th in GF, 28th in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;Mike Smith has the dubious honour of leading this team in Point Shares despite posting his worst save percentage since 2011.&lt;br /&gt;Ekman-Larson probably had a pretty good year, despite his situation. I should look up his possession stats. So we have two candidates:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oliver Ekman-Larson: 23G, 20A for 43P, -18 in 82 games, 25:13 ATOI; 8.8 PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mike Smith: 14-42-5, 0 SO, .904 SV%, 3.16 GAA; 9.3 PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Now, I'm inclined to go with Smith because, relative to the rest of the league, the Yotes were slightly bettter defensively than offensively, and obviously that has a lot to do with goaltending. But the lack of shutouts kind of wants me to give it to OEL. OEL played the sixth most minutes in the league of any skater, on a terrible team (everyone &lt;a href="http://www.hockey-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;amp;match=single&amp;amp;year_min=2015&amp;amp;year_max=2015&amp;amp;season_start=1&amp;amp;season_end=-1&amp;amp;rookie=N&amp;amp;age_min=0&amp;amp;age_max=99&amp;amp;birth_country=&amp;amp;franch_id=&amp;amp;is_active=&amp;amp;is_hof=&amp;amp;pos=S&amp;amp;handed=&amp;amp;c1stat=&amp;amp;c1comp=gt&amp;amp;c1val=&amp;amp;c2stat=&amp;amp;c2comp=gt&amp;amp;c2val=&amp;amp;c3stat=&amp;amp;c3comp=gt&amp;amp;c3val=&amp;amp;c4stat=&amp;amp;c4comp=gt&amp;amp;c4val=&amp;amp;order_by=time_on_ice" target="_blank"&gt;above him on that list&lt;/a&gt; is a potential Norris candidate) and the team around him is not his fault.&amp;nbsp; I'm really torn.&lt;br /&gt;But I'll give it to &lt;b&gt;Smith&lt;/b&gt; because the goalie is always the most valuable defender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Edmonton Oilers (26th in GF, 30th in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;This is an easy one. The Oilers were significantly better offensively than defensively (relative to the league).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jordan Eberle: &lt;/b&gt;24G, 39A for 63P, -16 in 82 games, 19:03 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Your Toronto Maple Leafs (24th in GF, 27th in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;Ugh. Nonis' version of this team has killed hockey for me even more than Burke's (far more than Burke's if I'm being fair). I may have a report card later this week even though &lt;i&gt;I didn't watch the games&lt;/i&gt;! &lt;br /&gt;Jonathan Bernier led the team in Point Shares by &lt;i&gt;a lot&lt;/i&gt; (okay, 4.1 to be precise, which is &lt;i&gt;a lot&lt;/i&gt;). But the team was better, relative to the league, offensively than it was defensively and so I think we have to go with a forward here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Phil Kessel&lt;/b&gt;: 25G, 36A for 61P, -34 in 82 games, 18:48 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Carolina Hurricanes (27th in GF, 19th in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;An almost average defensive team despite mediocre goaltending. That means a defenseman wins it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Justin Faulk&lt;/b&gt;: 15G, 34A for 49P, -19 in 82 games, 24:26 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;I think I have to take notice of this guy. Maybe he'S A Top 4 or even a Top 2 on a good team??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The New Jersey Devils (28th in GF, 14th in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;Well this is a no brainer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cory Schneider&lt;/b&gt;: 26-31-9, 5 SO, .925 SV%, 2.26 GAA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;He was, like, the whole team. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Philadelphia Flyers (22nd in GF, 24th in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;This one's a bit of a pickle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Steve Mason: 18-18-11, 3 SO, .928 SV%, 2.25 GAA; 11.3 PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jakub Voracek: 22G, 59A for 81P, +1 in 82 games, 18:36 ATOI; 8.8 PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Mason's line is rather amazing but the team was better offensively than defensively and Voracek finished on the leader boards in assists (2nd), points (tied 4th), goals created (14th), PP goals (11th), APG (3rd), PPG (9th), GCPG (20th). Mason was third in save percentage, 7th in GAA, 19th in Shut Outs, and 16th in overall PS. But, as I noted, the team was better offensively than defensively, and Mason didn't face anywhere near as many shots as his competition. &lt;b&gt;Voracek&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Florida Panthers (25th in GF, 18th in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;No question:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Roberto Luongo&lt;/b&gt;: 28-19-12, 2 SO, .921 SV%, 2.35 GAA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Columbus Blue Jackets (10th in GF, 25th in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;Bobrovsky somehow led this team in Point Shares but I can't pick a goalie on a team that's Top 10 in the league in offense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nick Foligno&lt;/b&gt;: 31G, 42A for 73P, +16 in 79 games, 18:50 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The San Jose Sharks (17th in GF, 23rd in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;Another team where their goalie (Niemi) leads the team in Point Shares despite boasting a far better offense than defense (in this case an average offense). But it's tight here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brent Burns: 17G, 43A for 60P, -9 in 82 games, 23:57 ATOI; 9.5 PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Joe Pavelski: 37G, 33A for 70P,&amp;nbsp;+12 in 82 games, 20:08 ATOI; 9.7 PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Point Shares are &lt;i&gt;way&lt;/i&gt; too biased towards Plus/Minus. For me, the more valuable thing is ice time. &lt;b&gt;Burns&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Colorado Avalanche (21st in GF, 21st in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;Equally deficient offense and defense tells me to give it to the PS leader, which is the goalie:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Semyon Varlamov&lt;/b&gt;: 28-20-8, 5 SO, .921 SV%, 2.56 GAA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Let's pause for a moment to once again mourn how Iginla came within 1 goal of being the 10th NHL player ever to score 30 goals thirteen times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;You've reached the halfway mark!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Boston Bruins (23rd in GF, 11 in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;No question:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tukka Rask&lt;/b&gt;: 34-21-13, 3 SO, .922 SV%, 2.30 GAA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Remember, this was a &lt;i&gt;down year&lt;/i&gt; for Rask. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Dallas Stars (2nd in GF, 26th in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;Well, this might be the easiest one. The Art Ross winner is the MVP of this team:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jamie Benn&lt;/b&gt;: 35G, 52A for 87P, +1 in 82 games, 19:57 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Anaheim Ducks (10th in GF, 19th in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;Somehow the Ducks tallied 109 points despite boasting an offense on the fringe of the Top 10 and a defense almost in the Bottom 10. This makes zero sense. And now they have won their first playoff game.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, Frederick Anderson is tied for the team lead in Point Shares but I think the forward he's tied with should get it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ryan Getzlaf&lt;/b&gt;: 25G, 45A for 70P, +16 in 77 games, 20:06 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Pittsburgh Penguins (18th in GF, 9th in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;The reverse case of the Ducks. For once Fleury has been better than average:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marc-Andre Fleury&lt;/b&gt;: 34-20-9, 10 SO, .920 SV%, 2.32 GAA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Seriously, it's been a career regular season for him: second most shots he's ever faced in a single season and his best save percentage in which he's played in more than 35 games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Detroit Red Wings (12th in GF, 16th in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;He hasn't played enough, but he's been better than everyone else on the team:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pavel Datsyuk&lt;/b&gt;: 26G, 39A for 65P, +12 in 63 games, 19:03 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Los Angeles Kings (20th in GF, 7th in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;So because of puck luck (or what have you), the Kings find themselves on the outside looking in despite being better (in theory) than at least three other playoff teams. Here's the dilemma:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Drew Doughty: 7G, 39A for 46P, +3 in 82 games, 28:00 (!!!) ATOI; 8.6 PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jonathan Quick: 36-22-13, 6 SO, .918 SV%, 2.24 GAA; 12.1 PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The Kings were nearly an elite defensive team while being shockingly weak offensively (given their talent). Doughtly was played at practically &lt;a href="http://www.hockey-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;amp;match=single&amp;amp;year_min=&amp;amp;year_max=&amp;amp;season_start=1&amp;amp;season_end=-1&amp;amp;rookie=N&amp;amp;age_min=0&amp;amp;age_max=99&amp;amp;birth_country=&amp;amp;franch_id=&amp;amp;is_active=&amp;amp;is_hof=&amp;amp;pos=S&amp;amp;handed=&amp;amp;c1stat=time_on_ice&amp;amp;c1comp=gt&amp;amp;c1val=2300&amp;amp;c2stat=&amp;amp;c2comp=gt&amp;amp;c2val=&amp;amp;c3stat=&amp;amp;c3comp=gt&amp;amp;c3val=&amp;amp;c4stat=&amp;amp;c4comp=gt&amp;amp;c4val=&amp;amp;order_by=ps" target="_blank"&gt;Prongerian levels&lt;/a&gt; this season but Quick had 6 shutouts (that's a lot). On the other hand, Quick's save percentage was rather pedestrian and doesn't he have to shoulder at least some of the blame for those 13 OT and Shoot Out losses? &lt;b&gt;Doughty&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Vancouver Canucks (6th in GF, 17th in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;Here's the dilemma:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Daniel Sedin: 20G, 56A for 76P, +5 in 82 games played, 18:21 ATOI; 8.5 PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Radim Vrbata: 31G, 32A for 63P, +6 in 79 games played, 16:37 ATOI; 8.6 PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;I was kidding about it being a dilemma. &lt;b&gt;Sedin (Daniel)&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Ottawa Senators (9th in GF, 13th in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;So here is a dilemma of another sort:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Andrew Hammond: 20-1-2, 3 SO, .941 SV%, 1.79 GAA; 6.5 PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Erik Karlsson: 21G, 45A for 66P, +7 in 82 games; 27:15 ATOI; 11.9 PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;That should be easy, right? Hammond didn't play enough and Karlsson played a &lt;i&gt;ton&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;But&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;, Hammond is the only reason the Sens are in the playoffs, really. Hammond doesn't qualify for the leader boards but can we really omit him because of something as silly as that? I think it ha to be &lt;b&gt;Hammond&lt;/b&gt; due to the particular nature of his success and his team's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Calgary Flames (8th in GF, 14th in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;We all know the fancy stats say the Flames shouldn't have made the playoffs, but apparently the less fancy stats say otherwise! This was Giordano's award to lose (as was the Norris) as he put up 9 PS in only 60 games, but obviously, he got hurt and the Flames still made it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jiri Hudler: 31G, 45A for 76P, +17 in 78 games, 18:01 ATOI; 10.2 PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dennis Wideman: 15G, 41A for 56P, +6 in 80 games, 24:39 ATOI; 10.1 PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Hudler wins on PSPG (well, Giordano would then) but Wideman played a lot more than he did, so I give to &lt;b&gt;Wideman&lt;/b&gt;. Can't give an MVP to a player who missed as much time as Giordano did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The New York Islanders (3rd in GF, 22nd in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;A ridiculously easy one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;John Tavares&lt;/b&gt;: 38G, 48A for 86P, +5 in 82 games, 20:40 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Winnipeg Jets (15th in GF, 9th in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;This is a little harder:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dustin Byfuglien: 18G, 27A for 45P, +5 in 69 games, 22:41 ATOI; 8.8 PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ondrej Pavelec: 22-16-8, 5 SO, .920 SV%, 2.28 GAA; 9 PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blake Wheeler: 26G, 35A for 61P, +26 in 79 games, 19:40 ATOI; 8.4 PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Byfuglien didn't really play enough (only twelve total minutes more than Wheeler) though he was pretty close to the team's most valuable player when he did play. Pavelec also didn't quite play enough. But those shutouts are huge. Wheeler was the best offensive player on an average offensive team. &lt;b&gt;Pavelec&lt;/b&gt;, barely. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Nashville Predators (13th in GF, 8th in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;Another somewhat difficult choice:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Roman Josi: 15G, 40A for 55P, +15 in 81 games, 26:28 ATOI; 10.8 PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pekka Rinne: 41-17-6, 4 SO, .923 SV%, 2.18 GAA; 12.6 PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Despite the reputation of this being an off year for Rinne - at least since January - it was among his best. Josi had a career year and would deserve this any other year.&amp;nbsp; But it's hard for me not to give it to Rinne, despite his injury problems and his regression over the course of the year, because of his overall numbers. Virtual tie, I grudginly give it to &lt;b&gt;Rinne&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Montreal Canadiens (18th in GF, 1 in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;Well obviously it's &lt;b&gt;Price&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Minnesota Wild (14th in GF, 4th in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;So, this is an interesting question (though it's the same as the Ottawa question):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Devan Dubnyk: 27-9-2, 5 SO, .936 SV%, 1.78 GAA; 9.4 PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zach Parise: 33G, 29A for 62P, +21 in 74 games, 19:11 ATOI; 9.1 PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Do we give it to the guy who was only there half the season, but saved the season? Or do we give it to the guy who was there the whole time? It's easier than the Senators problem because the Wild's MVS was a forward. So &lt;b&gt;Dubnyk&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Washington Capitals (6th in GF, 6th in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;If the Hart winner doesn't deserve his own team MVP, then we've got problems, in theory. But...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Braden Holtby: 41-20-10, 9 SO, .923 SV%, 2.22 GAA; 14.4 PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ovechkin: 12.6 PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Remember I restric the Hart to skaters, not so much team MVPs. By PS alone Holtby wins it (and look at those 9 shutouts!) but give that the team was equally good at both ends (relative to the league), I'd say it's a toss up. The PS would say Holtby, the Hart says &lt;b&gt;Ovechkin&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&amp;nbsp;The Chicago Blackhawks (16th in GF, 1st in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;Well, this is easy:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Corey Crawford&lt;/b&gt;: 32-20-5, 2 SO, .924 SV%, 2.27 GAA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Tampa Bay Lightning (1st in GF, 11th in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;Between two forwards as they were clearly a better offensive team than defensive:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tyler Johnson: 29G, 43A for 72P, +33 in 77 games, 17:14 ATOI; 10.3 PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Steven Stamkos: 43G, 29A for 72P, +2 in 82 games, 19:22 ATOI; 10.1 PS&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;So PS, PSPG and PPG give it to Johnson. There are two problems with this: I think there are very few people in the league who would argue Johnson doesn't benefit from playing with Stamkos. There is a more objective objection though - Stamkos played more (over 250 minutes more over the course of the season) and PS is way too biased towards plus/minus, which is mostly luck. So &lt;b&gt;Stamkos&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The St. Louis Blues (5th in GF, 4th in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;Surprisingly clear cut:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vladimir Tarasenko&lt;/b&gt;: 37G, 36A for 73P, +27 in 77 games, 17:37 ATOI&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The New York Rangers (3rd in GF, 3rd in GA)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rick Nash&lt;/b&gt; as we discovered earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There you have it, all the awards that should exist and don't and the awards I will never be allowed to vote for. Now let's see how the NHL manages to screw this up in a few months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/feeds/4968837926303323560/comments/default" rel="replies" title="Post Comments" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=8545641&amp;postID=4968837926303323560&amp;isPopup=true" rel="replies" title="0 Comments" type="text/html"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/4968837926303323560" rel="edit" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://www.blogger.com/feeds/8545641/posts/default/4968837926303323560" rel="self" type="application/atom+xml"/><link href="http://superchicken46.blogspot.com/2015/04/2014-15-nhl-awards.html" rel="alternate" title="2014-15 NHL Awards" type="text/html"/><author><name>Riley Haas</name><uri>https://plus.google.com/102201029100984588753</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image height="32" rel="http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail" src="//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-n_vvvSADmg0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAck/2h5ojO97FxM/s512-c/photo.jpg" width="32"></gd:image></author><thr:total>0</thr:total><gd:extendedproperty name="commentSource" value="1"></gd:extendedproperty><gd:extendedproperty name="commentModerationMode" value="FILTERED_POSTMOD"></gd:extendedproperty></entry></feed>
